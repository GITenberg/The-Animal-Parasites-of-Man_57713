<p>Small viewing devices might not display this e-book correctly
because of the complexity of the text, its length, and the presence
within it of some uncommon typographic characters. It is best viewed on
a large screen with character encoding set to Unicode (UTF-8).</p>

<p>The text has mostly been preserved in its original form, including
inconsistent italics, capitalisation, hyphenation and diacritics;
however, some infelicities have been corrected silently, e.g.
missing/inconsistent punctuation, parentheses and spacing. Several
footnote markers have been inserted where they were missing from the
text. The <i>very</i> long table of contents has somewhat inconsistent
levels of indentation that donât correspond accurately with headings
used in the text. Some illustrations have been moved nearer to the
relevant text and their locations may differ from those specified
in the list of illustrations. A few illustrations that lacked an
identifying number have been correctly numbered. The book contains
extensive sections of quoted text but these are identified by square
brackets rather than by traditional quotation marks. Several short
passages of text were inserted by the printer at the last minute, and
these are enclosed in lightly shaded text boxes. Two different sized
fonts were used to print the original body text, a feature that is
replicated in this e-transcription.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The English edition of Braunâs âDie Tierischen Parasiten des
Menschen,â produced in 1906, being out of print, the publishers
decided to issue another edition based on the translation of Braunâs
fourth German edition, which appeared in 1908, to which had been
added an appendix, by Dr. Otto Seifert on Treatment, etc.</p>

<p>When the work was considered with a view to a new edition,
it was found that a vast amount of new matter had to be incorporated,
numerous alterations essential for bringing it up to date were necessitated,
and many omissions were inevitable. The result is that parts of
the book have been rewritten, and, apart from early historical references,
the work of Braun has disappeared. This is more particularly the case
with the Protozoa section of the present work. The numerous additions,
due to the great output of scientific literature and other delays in
publication, have led to the book being somewhat less homogeneous
than we desired, and have necessitated the use of appendices to
allow of the presentation of new facts only recently ascertained.
Many new illustrations have been added or substituted for older, less
detailed ones. Some of these new figures were drawn specially for
this book.</p>

<p>The first section, on the Protozoa, has been written by Dr. Fantham,
there being little of the original text left except parts of the historical
portions, and thus the section on Protozoa must be considered as
new. The second section, on Worms (except the Acanthocephala,
GordiidÃ¦ and Hirudinea), has been remodelled by Professor Stephens
to such an extent that this, too, must not be looked upon as a
translation of Braunâs book. With regard to the Arthropoda,
much remains as in the last English edition, but some new matter
added by Braun in his fourth German edition is included, and much
new matter by Mr. Theobald has been incorporated. As regards
the Appendix by Dr. Seifert, the first section has been remodelled,
but the sections on the Helminthes and the Arthropoda are practically
translations of the original.</p>

<p>The authors desire to express their thanks to Miss A. Porter, D.Sc.,
J.&nbsp;P. Sharples, Esq., B.A., M.R.C.S., and H.&nbsp;F. Carter, Esq., F.E.S.,
for valuable help. They also wish to thank the authors, editors, and<span class="pagenum" title="iv"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a></span>
publishers of several manuals and journals for their courtesy in
allowing the reproduction of certain of their illustrations. In this
connection mention must be made more particularly of Professor
Castellani, Dr. Chalmers, Professor Doflein, Dr. Leiper, the late
Professor Minchin, Professor Nuttall, Dr. Wenyon, Mr. Edw. Arnold,
Messrs. BailliÃ¨re, Tindall and Cox, Messrs. Black, Messrs. Cassell,
Dr. Gustav Fischer, Messrs. Heinemann, the Cambridge University
Press, the Editors of the <i>Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology</i>,
the Editors of the <i>Journal of Experimental Medicine</i>, and the Editor
of the <i>Tropical Diseases Bulletin</i>.</p>

<h2>ON PARASITES IN GENERAL.</h2>


<p>By the term <span class="lowercase smcap">PARASITES</span> is understood living organisms which,
for the purpose of procuring food, take up their abode, temporarily
or permanently, on or within other living organisms. There are
both plants and animals (Phytoparasites and ZoÃ¶parasites) which
lead a parasitic life in or upon other plants and other animals.</p>

<p>Phytoparasites are not included in the following descriptions of
the forms of parasitism, but a very large number of animal parasites
(zoÃ¶parasites) are described. The number of the latter, as a rule,
is very much underrated. How great a number of animal parasites
exists may be gathered from the fact that all classes of animals are
subject to them. Some of the larger groups, such as <i>Sporozoa</i>, <i>Cestoda</i>,
<i>Trematoda</i> and <i>Acanthocephala</i>, consist entirely of parasitic species,
and parasitism even occurs among the vertebrates (<i>Myxine</i>). It
therefore follows that the characteristics of parasites lie, not in their
structure, but in the manner of their existence.</p>

<p>Parasitism itself occurs in various ways and degrees. According
to R. Leuckart, we should distinguish between <span class="lowercase smcap">OCCASIONAL</span> (temporary)
and <span class="lowercase smcap">PERMANENT</span> (stationary) <span class="lowercase smcap">PARASITISM</span>. Occasional parasites, such
as the flea (<i>Pulex irritans</i>), the bed-bug (<i>Cimex lectularius</i>), the leech
(<i>Hirudo medicinalis</i>), and others, only seek their âhostâ to obtain
nourishment and find shelter while thus occupied. Without being
bound to the host, they usually abandon the latter soon after the
attainment of their object (<i>Cimex, Hirudo</i>), or they may remain on
the body of their host throughout their entire development from the
hatching of the egg (<i>Pediculus</i>). It follows from this mode of living
that the occasional parasites become sometimes distinguishable from
their free-living relatives, though only to a slight extent. It is, therefore,
seldom difficult to determine the systematic position of temporary
parasites from their structure.</p>

<p>In consequence of their mode of life, all these temporary parasites
live on the external surface of the body of their host, though more
rarely they take up their abode in cavities easily accessible from the
exterior, such as the mouth, nose and gills. They are therefore
frequently called <span class="smcap">Epizoa</span> or <span class="smcap">Ectoparasites</span>; but these designations<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
do not cover only the temporary parasites, because numerous epizoa
(as for instance the louse) are parasitic during their entire life.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to these temporary parasites, the permanent
parasites obtain shelter as well as food from their host for a long
period, sometimes during the entire course of their life. They do not
seek their host only when requiring nourishment, but always remain
with it, thus acquiring substantial protection. The permanent parasites,
as a rule, live within the internal organs, preferably in those
which are easily accessible from the exterior, such as the intestine, with
its appendages. Nevertheless, permanent parasites are also found in
separate organs and systems, such as the muscular and vascular
systems, hollow bones and brain, while some live on the outer skin.
Here again, the terms <span class="smcap">Entozoa</span> and <span class="smcap">Endoparasites</span> do not include all
stationary parasites; to the latter, for instance, the lice belong, which
pass all their life on the surface of the body of their host, where they
find shelter and food and go through their entire development. The
ectoparasitic trematodes, numerous insects, crustacea, and other
animals live in the same manner.</p>

<p>All â<span class="smcap">Helminthes</span>,â however, belong to the group of permanent
parasites. This term is now applied to designate certain lowly worms
which lead a parasitic life (intestinal worms); but they are not all
so termed. For instance, the few parasitic <span class="smcap">Turbellaria</span> are never
classed with the helminthes, although closely related to them. The
turbellarians, in fact, belong to a group of animals of which only
a few members are parasitic, whereas the helminthes comprise those
groups of worms of which all species (<i>Cestoda</i>, <i>Trematoda</i>, <i>Acanthocephala</i>),
or at least the majority of species (<i>Nematoda</i>), are parasitic.
Formerly the LinguatulidÃ¦ (<i>Pentastoma</i>) were classed with the
helminthes because their existence is also endoparasitic, and because
the shape of their body exhibits a great similarity to that of the true
helminthes. Since the study of the development of the LinguatulidÃ¦
(P.&nbsp;J. van Beneden, 1848, and R. Leuckart, 1858) has demonstrated
that they are really degenerate arachnoids, they have been separated
from the helminthes.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to emphasize the fact that the helminthes
or intestinal worms do not represent a systematic group of animals,
but only a biological one, and that the helminthes can only be discussed
in the same sense as land and water animals are mentioned,
<i>i.e.</i>, without conveying the idea of a classification in such a grouping.
It is true that formerly this was universally done, but very soon the
error of such a classification was recognized. Still, until the middle
of last century, the helminthes were regarded as a systematic group,
although C.&nbsp;E. v. Baer (1827) and F.&nbsp;S. Leuckart (1827) strenuously
opposed this view. Under the active leadership of J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;E. Goeze,<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
J.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;H. Zeder, J.&nbsp;G. Bremser, K.&nbsp;A. Rudolphi and F. Dujardin, the
knowledge of the helminthes (helminthology) developed into a special
study, but unfortunately it lost all connection with zoology. It
required the intervention of Carl Vogt to disestablish the helminthes
as one class of animals, by uniting the various groups with those of
the free-living animals most closely related to them (<i>Platyhelminthes,
Nemathelminthes</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Permanent parasitism</span> in the course of time has caused
animals adopting this mode of life to undergo considerable, sometimes
even striking, bodily changes, permanent ectoparasites having
as yet undergone least alteration. The latter sometimes bear so
unmistakably the likeness to the group to which they belong, that
even a superficial knowledge of their structure and appearance often
suffices for the recognition of their systematic position. For instance,
though the louse, like many decidedly temporary parasites, has lost
its wings&mdash;a characteristic of insects&mdash;in consequence of parasitism,
yet nobody would deny its insect nature; such also occurs in other
temporary parasites (<i>Cimex, Pulex</i>). On the other hand, the changes
in a number of permanent ectoparasites (such as parasitic Crustacea)
are far more considerable, and correspond with those that have
occurred in permanent endoparasites.</p>

<p>These alterations depend partly on retrogression and partly on
the acquisition of new peculiarities. In the former case, the change
consists in the loss of those organs which have become useless in a
permanent parasitic condition of existence, such as wings in the
louse, and the articulated extremities seen in the larval stage of
parasitic Crustacea. The loss of these organs goes hand in hand
with the cohesion of segments of the body that were originally
separate, and alterations in the muscular and nervous systems. In
the same manner another means of locomotion is lost&mdash;the ciliated
coat&mdash;which is possessed by many permanent parasites during their
larval period. To all appearances, this character is not secondary
and recently acquired, but represents a primary character inherited
from free-living progenitors, and still transmitted to the altered
descendants, because of its use during the larval stage (<i>e.g.</i>, the larvÃ¦
of a great many Trematodes, the oncospheres of some Cestodes).
Amongst the retrogressions, the loss of the organs of sense may
be mentioned, particularly the eyes, which are still present, not only
in the nearest free-living forms but also in the free-living larvÃ¦ of
true parasites. It is only quite exceptionally that the eyes are
subsequently retained, as a rule they are lost. Lastly, in a great
many cases the digestive system also disappears, as in parasitic
Crustacea, in a few nematodes and trematodes, in all cestodes and
Acanthocephala. There remain at most the rudiments of the muscles
of the fore-gut, but these are adapted to entirely different uses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span></p>

<p>The new characters which permanent parasites may acquire are,
first of all, the remarkably manifold <span class="lowercase smcap">CLASPING</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">CLINGING ORGANS</span>,
which are seldom (as in parasitic Crustacea) directly joined on to
already existing structures. In those instances in which organs
for the conveyance of food are retained, these likewise frequently
undergo transformation, in consequence of the altered food and
manner of feeding. Such alterations consist, for instance, in the
transformation of a masticating mouth apparatus into the piercing
and sucking organs of parasitic insects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hermaphroditism</span> (as in Trematodes, Cestodes, and a few Nematodes)
is a further peculiarity of many permanent parasites; moreover,
the association in couples that occurs, especially in trematodes, may
lead to complete cohesion and, exceptionally, also to re-separation
of the sexes. In many cases the females only are parasitic, while
the males live a free life, or there may be in addition the so-called
complementary males. Occasionally the male alone is parasitic, and
in that case lives within the female of the same species, which may
live free, like certain Gephyrea (<i>Bonellia</i>); or the female also may
be parasitic, as <i>Trichosoma crassicaudum</i>, which lives in the bladder
of the sewer rat (<i>Mus decumanus</i>).</p>

<p>We have numerous proofs that demonstrate how considerably
the original features of many parasites have become changed. We
need only draw attention to the aforementioned LinguatulidÃ¦, also
to many of the parasitic Crustacea belonging to various orders. In
all of these a knowledge of the larval stages&mdash;in which there is no
alteration, or at most only a slight degree of change&mdash;serves to
determine their systematic position, <i>i.e.</i>, the nearest conditions of
relationship.</p>

<p>The most remarkable changes are observed in those groups that
contain only a few parasitic members, the majority leading a free
life. A striking instance is afforded by a snail, the well-known <i>Entoconcha
mirabilis</i>, MÃ¼ller. This mollusc consists merely of an elongated
sac living in a Holothurian (<i>Synapta digitata</i>). It possesses none
of the characteristics of either the Gastropoda or any molluscs,
and in its interior there is nothing to be observed but the organs
of generation and the embryos. Nevertheless, the <i>Entoconcha</i> is
decidedly a parasitic snail, as is clearly proved by its larvÃ¦, but
it is a snail which, in consequence of parasitism, has lost all the
characteristics of molluscs in its mature condition, but still exhibits
them in the early stages of development.</p>

<p>Certain nematodes show very clearly to what devious courses
parasitism may lead. The <i>Atractonema gibbosum</i>, the life-history of
which has been described by R. Leuckart, and which lives in the
larvÃ¦ and pupÃ¦ of a dipterous insect (<i>Cecidomyia</i>), exhibits, in its<span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>
early stage, the ordinary characteristics of other threadworms. A
few weeks later&mdash;the males having died off immediately after copulation&mdash;the
females are transformed into spindle-shaped bodies, the
mouth and anus of which are closed. They carry with them an irregularly
shaped appendage, in which the segmenting ova are situated,
and in which the further conditions of life of the <i>Atractonema</i> are
accomplished. A minute examination has demonstrated that this
appendage is the prolapsed and enlarged vagina of the animal which
has become merely a supplementary attachment. The conditions
present in the <i>SphÃ¦rularia</i>, the nematoid nature of which was long
undiscovered, are still more remarkable. It was only when Siebold
proved that typical nematodes were hatched from their eggs
that their nature was recognized. The nematodes thus produced
have not the slightest resemblance to the parent.</p>

<p>The researches of Lubbock, A. Schneider, and more particularly
of R. Leuckart, have shown that what we call <i>SphÃ¦rularia bombi</i> is not
an animal but merely an organ&mdash;the vagina&mdash;of a nematode worm.
This vagina at first grows, sac-like, from the body of the tiny nematode;
it gradually assumes enormous dimensions (2&nbsp;cm. in length);
it contains the sexual organs and parts of the intestine. The remaining
portion of the actual animal then becomes small and shrivelled;
it may be easily overlooked, being but an appendage to the vagina
with its independent existence, and it finally disappears altogether.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">GREAT FERTILITY</span> of parasites is another of their peculiarities,
though this may be also the case to a certain degree with some of
the free-living animals, the progeny of which are likewise exposed
to enormous destruction.</p>

<p>More remarkable, however, is the fact that the young of the
endoparasites only very exceptionally grow to maturity by the side
of their parents. Sooner or later they leave the organ inhabited by
the parents, frequently reach the open, and after a shorter or longer
period of free existence seek new hosts. During their free period,
moreover, a considerable growth may be attained, or metamorphosis
may take place, or even multiplication. In the exceptional cases in
which the young remain within the same host, they nevertheless
usually quit the organ inhabited by the parents. They likewise rarely
attain maturity within the host inhabited by the parents, but only,
as in other cases, after having gained access to fresh hosts.</p>

<p>These transmigrations play a very important <i>rÃ´le</i> in the natural
history of the internal parasites, but they frequently conceal the cycle
of development, for sometimes there are <span class="lowercase smcap">INTERMEDIATE GENERATIONS</span>,
which themselves invade intermediate hosts. Even when there are no
intermediate generations, <span class="lowercase smcap">THE SYSTEM OF INTERMEDIATE HOSTS</span> is
frequently maintained by the endoparasites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span></p>

<p>According to the kind of food ingested by parasites, it has
recently become usual to separate the true parasites from those
animals that feed on the superfluity of the food of the host, or on
products which are no longer necessary to him, and to call the latter
<span class="lowercase smcap">MESSMATES</span> or <span class="lowercase smcap">COMMENSALS</span>. As examples, the RicinidÃ¦ are thus
designated, because, like actual lice, they dwell among the fur of
mammals or the plumage of birds. They do not, however, suck
blood, for which their mouth apparatus is unsuited, but subsist
on useless epidermic scales. These epizoa, according to J.&nbsp;P. van
Beneden, are, to a certain extent, useful to their hosts by removing
deciduous materials which under certain circumstances might become
harmful to them.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> This investigator, who has contributed so greatly
to our knowledge of parasites, assigns the Ricines to the <span class="lowercase smcap">MUTUALISTS</span>,
under which term he comprises animals of various species which
live in common, and confer certain benefits on one another. The
mutualists are usually intimately connected in a mutually advantageous
association known as âsymbiosis.â<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p><i>Incidental and Pseudo Parasites.</i>&mdash;In many cases the parasites are
confined to certain hosts, and may therefore be designated as <i>specific</i>
to such hosts. Thus, hitherto, <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i> and <i>TÃ¦nia saginata</i>
in their adult condition have only been found in man; <i>TÃ¦nia crassicollis</i>
only in the cat; <i>Brandesia</i> (<i>Distoma</i>) <i>turgida</i> and <i>Halipegus</i>
(<i>Distoma</i>) <i>ovocaudatas</i> only in <i>Rana esculenta</i>, and so forth. In many
other cases, however, certain species of parasites are common to several,
and sometimes many, species of hosts; <i>Dipylidium caninum</i> is found
in the domestic cat as well as in the dog; <i>Fasciola hepatica</i> is found in
a large number of herbivorous mammals (nineteen species), <i>Diplodiscus</i>
(<i>Amphistomum</i>) <i>subclavatus</i> in numerous urodele and ecaudate amphibia,
<i>Holostomum variabile</i> in about twenty-four species of birds,
and so on. In these cases the hosts are almost invariably closely related,
belonging, as a rule, to the same family or order, or at any rate to the
same class. <i>Trichinella spiralis</i>, which is found in man, and in the pig,
bear, rat, mouse, cat, fox, badger, polecat and marten, and is capable
of being artificially cultivated in the dog, rabbit, sheep, horse, in
other mammals, and even in birds, is one of the most striking
exceptions.</p>

<p>Some parasites are so strictly confined to one species of host that,
even when artificially introduced into animals very closely related<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
to their normal host, they do not thrive, but sooner or later, often
very quickly, die off, and very rarely establish themselves. For
example, repeated attempts have been made to rear the adult <i>TÃ¦nia
solium</i> in the dog, or to rear <i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i> in the ox, or the
<i>Cysticercus</i> of <i>TÃ¦nia saginata</i> in the pig, but they have always proved
unsuccessful. Only exceptionally has it been possible to transfer
<i>CÅnurus cerebralis</i>, the larval stage of a tapeworm (<i>TÃ¦nia cÅnurus</i>) of
the dog from the brain of the sheep to that of the domestic goat.
On the other hand, in the case of the TrichinellÃ¦ transference to
a different host is easily accomplished.</p>

<p>Under natural conditions, it is not uncommon for certain kinds
of specific parasites to occur occasionally in unusual hosts. Their
relationship to the latter is that of <span class="lowercase smcap">INCIDENTAL PARASITES</span>. Thus
<i>Echinorhynchus gigas</i>, a specific parasite of the pig, is only an
incidental parasite of man; <i>Fasciola hepatica</i> and <i>DicrocÅlium
lanceatum</i> are specific to numerous kinds of mammals, but may
be found incidentally in man. On the other hand, <i>Dibothriocephalus
latus</i>, a specific parasite of man, may occasionally take up its abode
in the dog, cat and fox. As a rule, all those parasites of man that
are only rarely met with, notwithstanding that human beings are
constantly being observed and examined by medical men, are
termed <span class="lowercase smcap">INCIDENTAL PARASITES OF MAN</span>. In many cases we are
acquainted with the normal or specific host of these parasites.
Thus we know the specific host of <i>Balantidium coli</i>, <i>Eimeria stiedÃ¦</i>,
<i>Fasciola hepatica</i>, <i>Dipylidium caninum</i>, etc.; in others the host is as
yet unknown. In the latter case the question partly relates to such
forms as have been so deficiently described that their recognition
is impossible, partly to parasites of man in various regions of the
earth, the Helminthes and parasites of which are totally unknown
or only slightly known, or finally to early developmental stages that
are difficult to identify. Animals that usually live free, and exceptionally
become parasitic, may likewise be called incidental parasites.
In this category are included a few <i>AnguillulidÃ¦</i> that have been
observed in man; also <i>Leptodera appendiculata</i>, which usually lives
free, but may occasionally become parasitic in black slugs (<i>Arion
empiricorum</i>): when parasitic it attains a larger size, and produces
far more eggs than when living a free life. In order to avoid errors,
the term âincidental parasitesâ should be confined to true parasites
which, besides living in their normal host, may also live in other
hosts. Leuckart speaks of <span class="lowercase smcap">FACULTATIVE PARASITISM</span> in such forms
as <i>Leptodera</i>. L. Oerley<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> succeeded in artificially causing <i>Leptodera</i>
(<i>Rhabditis</i>) <i>pellio</i> to assume facultative parasitism by introducing these<span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>
worms into the vagina of mice, where the parasites remained alive and
multiplied. <i>Leptodera pellio</i> dies in the intestines of mammals and
man; it remains alive in frogs, but always escapes into the open
with the fÃ¦ces.</p>

<p>Recently the incidental parasites of man have also been called
â<span class="smcap">Pseudo-parasites</span>â or â<span class="smcap">Pseudo-helminthes</span>.â Formerly, however,
these terms were applied not only to living organisms that do
not and cannot live parasitically, and that only exceptionally and
incidentally get into man, but also to any foreign bodies, portions
of animals and plants, or even pathological formations that left the
human system through the natural channels, and the true nature
of which was misunderstood. Frequently these bodies were described
as living or dead parasites and labelled with scientific names, as if
they were true parasites. A study of these errors, which formerly
occurred very frequently, would be as interesting as it would be
instructive. It is better not to use the expression pseudo-parasites for
incidental parasites, but to keep to the original meaning, for it is not
at all certain that pseudo-parasites are not described, even nowadays.</p>

<p><i>The Influence of Parasites on the Host.</i>&mdash;In a great many cases,
we are not in a position to state anything regarding any marked
influence exercised by the parasite on the organism, and on the conditions
of life, of the host. Most animals and many persons exhibit
few signs of such influence, an exception being infestation with
helminthes and certain other parasites which produce eosinophilia
in the blood. As a general rule, the parasite, which is always smaller
and weaker than its host, does not attempt to endanger the life
of the latter, as simultaneously its own existence would be threatened.
The parasite, of course, robs its host, but usually in a scanty and
sparing manner, and the injuries it inflicts can hardly be taken into
account. There are, however, numerous cases<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> in which the situation
of the parasites or the nature of their food, added to their number and
movements, may cause more or less injury, and even threaten the life
of the host. It stands to reason that a <i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i> situated in
the skin is of but slight importance, whereas one that has penetrated
the eye or the brain must give rise to serious disorders. A cuticular
or intestinal parasite is, as a rule, less harmful than a blood parasite.
A helminth, such as an <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> or a tapeworm, that
feeds on the residues of foodstuffs within the intestine, will hardly<span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
affect its host by depriving it of this material. The case is different
when the parasites are very numerous, especially when the heavily
infested host happens to be a young individual needing all it ingests
for its own requirements, and therefore unable to sustain the drain of
numerous intruders in the intestine. Disturbances also set in more
rapidly when the intestinal helminthes are blood-suckers, the injury
to the host resulting from the kind of food taken by the parasite.</p>

<p>Generally, the disorders caused by loss of chyle are insignificant
when compared with those induced by the <span class="lowercase smcap">GROWTH</span> and agglomeration
of the helminthes. The latter may cause chiefly obstructions of
small vessels or symptoms of pressure in affected or contiguous organs,
with all those complications which may arise secondarily, or they may
even lead to the complete obliteration of the organ invaded. Of course
the symptoms will vary according to the nature of the organ attacked.</p>

<p>In consequence also of the <span class="lowercase smcap">MOVEMENTS</span> of the parasites, disorders
are set up that may tend to serious pathological changes of the
affected organs. The collective migrations, undertaken chiefly by
the embryos of certain parasites (as in trichinosis, acute cestode
tuberculosis), are still more harmful, as are also the unusual migrations
of other parasites, which, incidentally, may lead to the formation
of so-called worm abscesses or to abnormal communications (fistulÃ¦)
between organs that are contiguous but possess no direct connection.</p>

<p>Recently, several authors have called attention to the fact that
the helminthes produce substances that are <span class="lowercase smcap">TOXIC</span> to their host; and
the effects of such poisons explain the pathology of helminthiasis
far more satisfactorily than the theory of reflex action.</p>

<p>In a number of cases these toxic materials (leucomaines) have been
isolated and their effects on living organisms demonstrated by actual
experiments. It also appears that the absorption of materials formed
by the decomposition of dead helminthes may likewise cause toxic
effects. However, our knowledge of these conditions is as yet in
its initial stage.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Nearly all the symptoms caused directly or indirectly by parasites
are of such a nature that the presence of the parasites cannot be
diagnosed with any certainty, or only very rarely. The most that
can be done is to deduce the presence of parasites by the exclusion
of other causes. Fortunately, however, there are sufficient means<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>
by which we may confirm the diagnosis in a great many cases. Such
means consist not only in a minute examination of the patient by
palpation, percussion and local inspection, but also in the microscopical
examination of the natural secretions and excretions of the
body, such as sputum, nasal mucus, urine and fÃ¦ces. Though such
examinations may entail loss of time, they are necessary in the interest
of the patient. It appears, moreover, that quackery, which has
gained considerable ground even in the treatment of the helminthic
diseases of man, can thus be considerably limited.</p>

<p><i>Origin of Parasites.</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>&mdash;In former times, when the only correct views
that existed related to the origin of the higher animals, the mode
of multiplication of parasites as well as of other lowly animals
was ascribed to <span class="lowercase smcap">SPONTANEOUS GENERATION</span> (<i>generatio Ã¦quivoca</i>), and
this opinion prevailed throughout the middle ages. The writers on
natural science merely devoted their time to the interpretation of the
views of the old authors, and perpetuated the opinions of the ancients
on questions, which, even in those days, could have been correctly
explained merely by observation.</p>

<p>It was only when observations were again recommenced, and the
microscope was invented, that the idea of spontaneous generation
became limited. Not only did the microscope reveal the organs of
generation or their products (eggs) in numerous animals, but Redi
succeeded in proving that the so-called <i>Helcophagi</i> (flesh maggots) are
only the progeny of flies, and never appear in the flesh of slaughtered
animals when fully developed flies are prevented from approaching
and depositing their eggs on it. Swammerdam likewise knew that
the âwormsâ living in the caterpillars of butterflies were the larvÃ¦
of other insects (ichneumon flies) which had laid their eggs in their
bodies; he also discovered the ova of lice. The two authors mentioned
were, however, unwilling to see that the experience they had
gained regarding insects applied to the helminthes. Leeuwenhoek
also vehemently opposed the theory of a spontaneous generation,
maintaining that, on a basis of common-sense, eggs, or at all events
germs, must exist, even though they could not be seen.</p>

<p>The use of the microscope also revealed a large number of very
small organisms in the water and moist soil, some of which undoubtedly
resembled helminthes. Considering the wide dissemination
of these minute organisms, it was natural to conjecture that after their
almost unavoidable introduction into the human system they should
grow into helminthes (Boerhave, Hoffmann). LinnÃ¦us went even
further, for he traced the descent of the liver-fluke of sheep from<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
a free-living planaria (<i>DendrocÅlum lacteum</i>), the <i>Oxyuris vermicularis</i>
from free-living nematodes, and the <i>TÃ¦nia lata</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Dibothriocephalus
latus</i>) from a tapeworm (<i>Schistocephalus solidus</i>) found free in the
water. LinnÃ¦usâ statements met with general approval. However,
we must bear in mind that at that time the number of helminthes
known was very small, and many of the forms that we have long
ago learned to differentiate as specific were then regarded as belonging
to one species. LinnÃ¦usâ statements were partly supported by similar
discoveries by other investigators, such as Unzer, and partly also by
the discovery of eggs in many helminthes. It was believed that the
eggs hatched in the outside world gave rise to free-living creatures,
and that these, after their introduction into the intestine, were transformed
into helminthes. By means of these eggs the old investigators
tried to explain the <span class="lowercase smcap">HEREDITARY TRANSMISSION</span> of the intestinal
worms, which was universally believed until the commencement of
the last century. Some authors went so far as to regard the intestinal
worms as congenital or inherited; they maintained the possibility
of direct transmission, as in suckling, and denied that the eggs
reaching the external world had anything to do with the propagation
of the parasites.</p>

<p>The more minute comparison between the supposed free-living
stages of the helminthes and their adult forms, and the impossibility
of finding corresponding free forms for the ever-increasing number
of parasitic species, revealed the improbability of LinnÃ¦usâ statements
(O. Fr. MÃ¼ller). It was the latter author also who recognized the
origin of the tapeworms (<i>Schistocephalus, Ligula</i>) found free in the
water. They originate from fishes which they quit spontaneously.</p>

<p>However, in spite of the fact that van Doeveren and Pallas
correctly recognized the significance of the eggs in the transmission
of intestinal worms, these statements remained disregarded,
as did Abildgaardâs observation, experimentally confirmed, that the
(immature) cestodes from the abdominal cavity of sticklebacks became
mature in the intestines of aquatic birds. Moreover, at the end of
the eighteenth and the commencement of the nineteenth centuries,
after helminthology had been raised to a special branch of study
by the successful results of the investigations of numerous authors
(Goeze, Bloch, Pallas, MÃ¼ller, Batsch, Rudolphi, Bremser), many
of whom experienced a âdivine joyâ in searching the intestines of
animals for helminthes, some authors reverted to <i>generatio Ã¦quivoca</i>,
without, however, entirely denying the existence of organs of generation
and eggs. The fact that a few nematodes bore living progeny&mdash;a
fact of which Goeze was already aware&mdash;had no influence on the
erroneous opinion, as in such cases it was considered that the young
continued to develop beside the old forms. There were also<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
many helminthes known that never developed sexual organs and
never produced eggs, and which therefore were referred to <i>generatio
Ã¦quivoca</i>. People were convinced that the intestinal mucous membrane
or an intestinal villus could transform itself into a worm,
either in a general morbid condition of the body, or in pathological
changes of a more local character. The appearance of helminthes
was even regarded as useful and as a means for the expulsion of
injurious matter.</p>

<p>These views, firmly rooted and supported by such eminent
authorities as Rudolphi and Bremser, could not easily be overthrown.
First, a change took place in the knowledge of the trematodes.
In 1773, O. Fr. MÃ¼ller discovered <i>CercariÃ¦</i> living free in water.
He regarded them as independent creatures and gave them the name
that is still used at the present time. Nitzsch, who also minutely
studied these organisms and who recognized the resemblance of
the anterior part of their bodies to a <i>Fasciola</i>, did not, however, arrive
at a correct conclusion. He regarded the combination rather as
that of a <i>Fasciola</i> with a <i>Vibrio</i>, for which he mistook the characteristic
tail of the cercaria. He also noticed the encystment (transformation
into the âpupaâ) on foreign bodies of many species of
these animals, but was of opinion that this process signified only the
termination of life.</p>

<p>Considerable attention was attracted to the matter when Bojanus
first published a paper entitled âA Short Note on Cercaria and their
Place of Origin.â He pointed out that the cercariÃ¦ creep out of the
âroyal yellow worms,â which occur in freshwater snails (<i>LimnÃ¦a,
Paludina</i>), and are probably generated in these worms.</p>

<p>Oken, in whose journal, <i>Isis</i> (1818, p.&nbsp;729), Bojanus published his
discovery, remarks in an annotation, âOne might lay a wager that
these CercariÃ¦ are the embryos of Distomes.â Soon after (1827),
C.&nbsp;E. v. Baer was able to confirm Bojanusâ hypothesis that the
cercariÃ¦ as a âheterogeneous broodâ originated from spores in parasitic
tubes in snails (germinating tubes). Moreover, Mehlis (<i>Isis</i>, 1831,
p. 190) not only discovered the opercula of the ova of <i>Distoma</i>, but
likewise saw the infusorian-like embryo emerge from the eggs of
<i>TyphlocÅlum</i> (<i>Monostomum</i>) <i>flavum</i> and <i>CathÃ¦masia</i> (<i>Distoma</i>) <i>hians</i>.
A few years later (1835) v. Siebold observed the embryos (miracidia) of
the <i>CyclocÅlum</i> (<i>Monostomum</i>) <i>mutabile</i>, and discovered in their interior
a cylindrical body that behaved like an independent being (ânecessary
parasiteâ), and was so similar in appearance to the âroyal yellow
wormsâ (Bojanus) that Siebold considered the origin of the latter from
the embryos of trematodes as, at all events, possible. Meanwhile,
v. Nordmann of Helsingfors had in 1832 seen the miracidia of flukes
provided with eyes swimming in water; v. Siebold (1835) had observed<span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
the embryos, or oncospheres, of tapeworms furnished with six
hooklets in the so-called eggs of the TÃ¦nia; while Creplin (1837) had
discovered the âinfusorialâ young of the <i>Diphyllobothrium</i> (<i>Bothriocephalus</i>)
<i>ditremum</i>, and conjectured that similar embryos were to be
found in other cestodes with operculated eggs. At all events, the fact
was established that the progeny of the helminthes appeared in various
forms and was partly free living. The researches of Eschricht (1841)
were likewise of influence, as they elucidated the structure of the
Bothriocephali, and proved that the encysted and sexless helminthes
were merely immature stages.</p>

<p>J.&nbsp;I. Steenstrup (1842) was, however, the first to furnish explanations
for the numerous isolated and uncomprehended discoveries.
Commencing with the remarkable development of the CÅlenterata,
he established the fact that the Helminthes, especially the endoparasitic
trematodes, multiply by means of alternating and differently
formed generations. Just as the polyp originating from the egg of
a medusa represents a generation of medusÃ¦, so does the germinal
tube (âroyal yellow wormâ) originating from the ciliated embryo of
a Distoma, etc., represent the cercaria. These were consequently
regarded as the progeny of trematodes, and Steenstrup, guided by
his observations, conjectured that the cercaria, whose entrance into
the snails he had observed accompanied by the simultaneous loss of
the propelling tail, finally penetrated into other animals, in which they
became flukes.</p>

<p>Part of this hypothetical cycle of development was erroneous, and
in other particulars positive observation was lacking, but the path
pursued was in the right direction. Immediately after the appearance
of Steenstrupâs celebrated work, v. Siebold expressed his opinion
that the encapsuled flukes certainly had to travel, <i>i.e.</i>, to be transmitted
with their bearers into other hosts, before becoming mature.
This view was experimentally confirmed by de Filippi, La Valette
St. George (1855), as well as by Pagenstecher (1857), while the metamorphosis
of the ciliated embryo of Distoma into a germinal tube
was first seen by G. Wagener (1857) in <i>Gorgodera</i> (<i>Distoma</i>) <i>cygnoides</i>
of frogs. All that we have subsequently learned from the works of
numerous investigators about the development of endoparasitic trematodes
has certainly increased our knowledge in various directions, and,
apart from the deviating development of the <i>HolostomidÃ¦</i> has, as a
whole, confirmed the briefly sketched cycle of development.</p>

<p>Steenstrupâs work on the cestodes did not attract the same attention
as his work on trematodes. Steenstrup always insisted on the
ânurseâ nature of the cysticerci and other bladder-worms. Abildgaard
(1790), as well as Creplin (1829 and 1839), had already furnished
the information that certain sexless cestodes (<i>Schistocephalus</i> and<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
<i>Ligula</i>) from the abdomen of fishes only become mature after their
transference to the intestine of aquatic birds. These passive
migrations were confirmed in an entire series of other cestodes,
particularly by v. Siebold (1844, 1848, 1850) and E.&nbsp;J. van Beneden
(1849), not by actual experiment, but by undoubted observation.</p>

<p>It was correctly believed that the ova or oncospheres penetrate
into certain intermediate hosts, in which they develop into unsegmented
larvÃ¦. Here they remain until, with their host, they are
swallowed by some predacious animal. They then reach the intestine,
being freed from the surrounding membranes through the process
of digestion, and settle themselves there to form the adult chain
of proglottides. Though some few scientists, such as P.&nbsp;J. van
Beneden and Em. Blanchard, deduced from these observations that
the bladder-worms (Cysticerci), which had hitherto been regarded as
a separate class of helminthes, were only larval TÃ¦niÃ¦, this correct
view was not at first universally accepted. The foundation was too
slight, and van Beneden was of opinion that the Cysticerci were not
necessary, but only appeared incidentally.</p>

<p>v. Siebold was a strenuous opponent to this theory, notwithstanding
his experiences on the change of hosts of the Tetrarhynchus.
Together with Dujardin (1850) he conjectured that the
TÃ¦niÃ¦ underwent a deviating cycle of development. He was of
opinion that the six-hooked oncospheres left the intestine, in
which the older generation lived, and were scattered about with
the fÃ¦ces, and finally re-entered <i>per os</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, with water and food)
a host similar to the one they had left, in the intestine of which
they were directly transformed into tapeworms. A change of host
such as occurred in other cestodes was not supposed to take place
(the history of the cestodes was at this time not entirely established).
As the oncospheres of the TÃ¦nia are enveloped in one
calcareous or several softer coverings which they cannot leave
actively, and as, in consequence of this condition, innumerable
oncospheres cannot penetrate into an animal, and others cannot
reach the proper animal, v. Siebold conceded, at least for the
latter, the possibility of a further development. But this was only
supposed to occur because they had either invaded wrong hosts,
or, having reached the right hosts, had penetrated organs unsuitable
to their development, and had thus gone astray in their
travels, and had become hydropically degenerated tÃ¦niÃ¦. This
was v. Sieboldâs explanation of bladder-worms. Naturally, v. Siebold
himself conjectured that a recovery of the diseased tapeworm might
occur, in a few exceptional cases, after transmission into the correct
host, as, for instance, in the <i>Cysticercus fasciolaris</i> of mice, the host of
which is the domestic cat, and in which there is a seemingly normally<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
developed piece of tapeworm situated between the caudal vesicle and
the cysticercus head.</p>

<p>Guided by correct views, F. KÃ¼chenmeister undertook in Zittau
the task of confirming the metamorphosis of <i>Cysticercus pisiformis</i>
of hares and rabbits, into tapeworms in the intestine of the dog
by means of feeding experiments. The first reports on the subject,
published in 1851, were not likely to meet with universal approval,
because KÃ¼chenmeister first diagnosed the actual tapeworm he had
been rearing as <i>TÃ¦nia crassiceps</i>, afterwards as <i>TÃ¦nia serrata</i>, and
finally as <i>TÃ¦nia pisiformis</i> n. sp. However, in any case, KÃ¼chenmeister,
by means of the reintroduction of experimental investigation, rendered
a great service to helminthology.</p>

<p>The publication of KÃ¼chenmeisterâs works induced v. Siebold
to undertake similar experiments (1852 and 1853), which were
partly published by his pupil Lewald in 1852. But the positive
results obtained hardly changed Sieboldâs opinion, for although he
no longer considered the bladder-worms as hydropically degenerated
tapeworms, he still regarded them as tÃ¦niÃ¦ that had strayed. The
change of opinion was partly due to an important work of the
Prague zoologist, v. Stein (1853). He was able to examine the
development of a small bladder-worm in the larvÃ¦ of the well-known
meal-worm (<i>Tenebrio molitor</i>) and to demonstrate that, as Goeze had
already proved in the case of <i>Cysticercus fasciolaris</i> of mice, first the
caudal vesicle is formed and then the scolex, whereas Siebold believed
that in bladder-worms the posterior end of the scolex was formed
first, and that this posterior end underwent a secondary hydropic
degeneration.</p>

<p>In opposition to v. Siebold, KÃ¼chenmeister successfully proved
the necessity of the bladder-worm stage by rearing tapeworms
in dogs from the <i>Cysticercus tenuicollis</i> of domestic mammals and
from the <i>CÅnurus cerebralis</i> of sheep. He, and simultaneously
several other investigators independently, succeeded, with material
provided by KÃ¼chenmeister, in rearing the <i>CÅnurus cerebralis</i> in
sheep from the oncospheres of the <i>TÃ¦nia cÅnurus</i> of the dog (1854).
R. Leuckart obtained similar results in mice by feeding them with the
mature proglottides of the <i>TÃ¦nia crassicollis</i> of cats (1854).</p>

<p>KÃ¼chenmeister also repeatedly reared the <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i> of man
from the <i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i> of pigs (1855), and from the embryos
of this parasite P.&nbsp;J. van Beneden succeeded in obtaining the same
<i>Cysticercus</i> in the pig (1854). As KÃ¼chenmeister distinguished the
<i>TÃ¦nia mediocanellata</i>, known to Goeze as <i>TÃ¦nia saginata</i>, amongst
the large tÃ¦niÃ¦ of man (1851), so it was not long before R. Leuckart
(1862) succeeded in rearing the cysticercus of the hookless tapeworm
in the ox. It is particularly to this last-named investigator that
helminthology is indebted more than to any other author. He<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
followed the gradual metamorphosis from oncospheres to cystic
worms in all its details.</p>

<p>In view of all the researches that were made, and which are too
numerous to mention individually, the idea that bladder-worms are
abnormal or only incidental forms had to be abandoned. Everything
pointed to the fact that in all cestodes the development is
divided between two kinds of animals; in one&mdash;the host, the adult
tapeworm is found; while in the other, the intermediate host, we
find some form or other of an intermediate stage (cysticercus in
the broadest sense). The practical application of this knowledge is
self-evident. If no infected pork or beef is ingested, no tapeworm
can be acquired, and also the rearing of cysticerci in the human body
is prevented by avoiding the introduction of the eggs of tapeworms.</p>

<p>Though these results were definitely proved by numerous
researches, yet they have been repeatedly challenged, notably by
J. Knoch (1862) in Petrograd, who, on the basis of experiments,
sought to confirm a direct development without an intermediate host
and ciliated stage, at all events as regards <i>Dibothriocephalus latus</i>.
However, the repeated communications of this author met with
but little favour from competent persons, partly because the
experiments were conducted very carelessly, and partly because
their repetition on dog and man (R. Leuckart) had no results
(1863). It was only in 1883 that Braun was able to prove that the
developmental cycle of <i>Dibothriocephalus latus</i> is similar to that of
other Cestodes. The results obtained in other places by Parona,
Grassi, Ijima and Zschokke render any discussion of KÃ¼chenmeisterâs
conclusions unnecessary.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Long after Knoch, a French author,
P. MÃ©gnin, also pleaded for the direct development of some
cestodes, and especially some tÃ¦niÃ¦. He (1879) also sought to
prove a genetic connection between the hookless and armed tapeworms
of mammals, but the arguments he adduced, so far as they
rest on observations, can be easily refuted or attributed to misinterpretation.
Only one of these arguments is correct, namely,
that the number of the species of tÃ¦niÃ¦ with which we are acquainted
is far larger than that of the corresponding cystic forms; but this
disparity alone cannot be taken as a proof of direct development.
It can only be said that our knowledge in this respect is deficient.
As a matter of fact, we have during recent years become acquainted
with a large number of cystic forms, hitherto unknown, belonging
to tÃ¦niÃ¦ which have long been familiar. It must also be borne in
mind that no man in his lifetime can complete an examination for
bladder-worms of the large number of insects, for instance, which<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
may destroy an entire generation of an insectivorous species of bird
within a small district.</p>

<p>Naturally it does not follow that direct development in the
cestodes is altogether lacking. The researches of Grassi (1889) have
furnished an example in <i>Hymenolepis</i> (<i>TÃ¦nia</i>) <i>murina</i>, which shows
that development may sometimes take place without an intermediate
host, notwithstanding the retention of the cystic stage. It was found
that the oncospheres of this species, introduced into rats of a certain
age, after a time grow into tapeworms without leaving the intestine,
but not directly, for they bore into the intestinal wall, where they
pass the cystic stage, the cysts afterwards falling into the intestinal
lumen, where they develop into tapeworms. The recent experiments
of Nicoll (1911) show that the larval stages of <i>Hymenolepis murina</i>
also occur in the rat-flea, <i>Ceratophyllus fasciatus</i>.</p>

<p>Important observations were soon made on the remaining
groups of helminthes. The discussion on the origin of parasites
soon became confined to the helminthes. Amongst the Nematoda,
it had long been known that encapsuled forms existed that had
at first been regarded as independent species, but very soon they were
pronounced to be immature forms, in consequence of their lack
of sexual organs. Though Dujardin and also v. Siebold regarded
them as âstrayedâ animals, v. Stein (1853) very promptly demonstrated
that the progeny of the nematodes were destined to travel
by discovering a perforating organ in the larval nematodes of the
mealworm. This was first experimentally confirmed (1860) by
R. Leuckart, R. Virchow and Zenker, all of whom succeeded not
only in bringing to maturity the muscle TrichinÃ¦ (known since 1830)
in the intestine of the animals experimented upon, but were likewise
able to follow the migrations of the progeny. Of course, the
encapsulating brood remained in the same organism, and in this
respect deviated from the broods of other helminthes which escape
into the outer world and find their way into other animals, but
the encapsuled nematodes could no longer be regarded as the
result of straying. Subsequently, R. Leuckart worked out, more
or less completely, the history of the development of numerous
nematodes, or pointed out the way in which further investigations
should be made. It has been found that in nematodes far more
frequently than in other helminthes, the typical course of development
is subject partly to curtailment and partly to complications,
which sometimes considerably increase the difficulties of investigation
and have hitherto prevented the attainment of a definite conclusion,
though the way to it is now clear.</p>

<p>In a similar manner the works of R. Leuckart have cleared
up the development of the <i>Acanthocephala</i> and <i>Linguatulida</i>. Of<span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>
course, much still remains to be done. So far, we do not even
know all the helminthes of man and of the domestic animals
in all their phases of life, and still less is known of those of
other animals. We are indebted to the discoveries of the
last fifty years for the knowledge arrived at, though comparatively
few names are connected with it. The gross framework
is revealed, but the gaps have only been filled up here and
there. However, we may trustfully leave the completion of the
whole to the future, without fear that any essential alterations will
take place.</p>

<p>The deductions to be drawn are as follows: That the helminthes
like the ectoparasites multiply by sexual processes, that the entire course
of development of the helminthes is rarely or never gone through
in the same host as is the case with several ectoparasites, that the
progeny at an earlier or later stage of development, as eggs, embryos,
or larvÃ¦, quit the host inhabited by the older generation, and almost
always attain the outer world: only in <i>Trichinella</i> does the development
take place directly in the definite host. Where the eggs have
not yet developed they go through the embryonic evolution in the
outer world. The young larvÃ¦ are transmitted, either still enclosed
within the egg or embryonic covering, to the intermediate host or
more rarely they are transferred straight to the final host. In other
cases they may hatch out from their envelopes, and after a longer or
shorter period of free life, during which they may partake of food and
grow, they, as before, penetrate, usually in an active way, into an
intermediate host, or at once invade the final host. Exceptionally
(<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Rhabdonema</i>), during the free life there may be a propagation of
the parasitic generation, and in this case only the succeeding generation
again becomes parasitic, and then at once reaches its final host.
The young forms which have invaded the final host become mature in
the latter, or after a longer or shorter period of parasitism again wander
forth (as the ÅstridÃ¦, IchneumonidÃ¦, etc.), and reach the adult stage
in the outer world. The young stages, during which the parasites
undergo metamorphoses or are even capable of producing one or
several intermediate generations, are passed in the intermediate hosts
until, as a rule, they are passively carried into the final host and there
complete their cycle of development by the formation of the organs
of generation. This mode of development, the spending of life in
two different kinds of animals (intermediate and final host), is typical
of the helminthes. This is manifested in the Acanthocephala, the
Cestoda, the majority of the endoparasitic Trematoda, a number of
the Nematoda, and the LinguatulidÃ¦. There are now and then
exceptions, however, in which, for instance, the host and intermediate
host change order (<i>Trichinella</i>, <i>Hymenolepis murina</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span></p>

<p>Parasites are hardly ever inherited amongst animals.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> According
to a few statements, however, <i>Trichinella</i> and <i>CÅnurus</i> are supposed
to be transmissible from the infected mother to the fÅtus. Otherwise
most animals acquire their parasites, especially the Entozoa, from
without, the parasites penetrating either actively, as in animals living
in the water, or passively with food and drink. A particular predisposition
to worms is not more likely than a spontaneous origin
of parasites.</p>

<p><i>Derivation of Parasites.</i>&mdash;Doubt now no longer exists as to the
derivation of the temporary and of many of the stationary ectoparasites
from free-living forms. This conclusion is founded on the
circumstance that not only are there numerous intermediate degrees
in the manner of living and feeding between predacious and parasitic
animals, but that there is more or less uniformity in their structure.
The differences that exist are easily explained as consequences of
altered conditions of life. The case is more difficult in regard to
groups that are exclusively parasitic (<i>Cestoda</i>, <i>Trematoda</i>, <i>Acanthocephala</i>,
<i>LinguatulidÃ¦</i>, and <i>Sporozoa</i>), or groups that are chiefly
parasitic (<i>Nematoda</i>), because in these cases the gulf that divides
these forms from free-living animals is wider. It is true that we know
that the nearest relatives of the <i>LinguatulidÃ¦</i> are found amongst the
<i>Arachnoidea</i>, and indeed in the <i>Acarina</i>; that, moreover, the structure
and development of the <i>Sporozoa</i> refers them to the <i>Protozoa</i>, and
allows some of them to be regarded as the descendants of the lowest
<i>Rhizopoda</i>. We know that the <i>Trematoda</i>, and through these the
<i>Cestoda</i>, are closely related to the <i>Turbellaria</i>, from which they may
be traced. The <i>Nematoda</i>, and still more the <i>Acanthocephala</i>, stand
apart. This is less evident, however, in the Nematoda, for there
are numerous free-living members of these from which it is possible
that the parasitic species may be descended. Indeed, this seems
more than probable if such examples as <i>Leptodera</i>, <i>Rhabdonema</i> and
<i>Strongyloides</i> are taken into consideration, as well as the conditions
of life of free-living nematodes. These mostly, if not exclusively,
spend their lives in places where decomposing organic substances
are present in quantities; some species attain maturity only in such
localities, and there propagate very rapidly. Should the favourable
conditions for feeding be changed, the animals seek out other
localities, or they remain in the larval form for some time until more
favourable conditions set in. It is comprehensible that such forms
are very likely to adopt a parasitic manner of life which at first is
facultative (<i>Leptodera</i>, <i>Anguillula</i>), but may be regarded as the transition
<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>to true parasitism. The great advantages attached to a parasitic
life consist not only in protection, but also in the supply of suitable
food, and consequently in the easier and greater production of eggs,
and thus fully account for the gradual passage of facultative parasitism
into true parasitism. In many forms the young stages live free for
some time (<i>StrongylidÃ¦</i>), in others, as is the case in <i>Rhabdonema</i>,
parasitic and free-living generations alternate; in others, again, the
free period is limited to the egg stage or entirely suppressed.</p>

<p>Though it is possible thus to connect the parasitic with the free-living
nematodes, by taking their manner of life into account, this
matter presents greater difficulties in regard to other helminthes. It
is true that the segmented Cestoda may be connected with and traced
from the less known and interesting single-jointed Cestoda (<i>Amphilina</i>,
<i>Archigetes</i>, <i>CaryophyllÃ¦us</i>, <i>Gyrocotyle</i>). Trematodes are all parasites,
with the exception of one group, <i>TemnocephalidÃ¦</i>, several genera and
species of which live on the surface of the bodies of Crustacea and
turtles of tropical and sub-tropical freshwaters. <i>TemnocephalidÃ¦</i> are,
nevertheless, predacious. They feed on Infusoria, the larvÃ¦ of small
insects and Crustacea. So far as is known they do not nourish themselves
on part of the host. They belong to the group of commensals,
or more correctly, to that of the <span class="lowercase smcap">SPACE PARASITES</span>, which simply dwell
with their host and do not even take a portion of the superfluity of
its food. However, space parasitism may still be regarded as the
first stage of commensalism, which is again to be regarded as a sort
of transition to true parasitism.</p>

<p>It is possible that parasitism came about in this way in the
trematodes, in which connection we must first consider the turbellaria-like
ancestors of the trematodes. Much can be said in favour of
such a genetic relationship between turbellaria and trematodes, and
hardly anything against it. It should also be remembered that
amongst the few parasitic turbellaria there are some that possess
clinging discs or suctorial pores, and these are only differentiated
from ectoparasitic trematodes by the possession of a ciliated integument,
which is found only in the larval stages of the latter.</p>

<p>The Acanthocephala occupy an isolated position. Most authors
certainly regard them as related to the nematodes; in any case,
the connection is not a close one, and the far-reaching alterations
which must have occurred prevent a clear view. Perhaps the free
original forms of Acanthocephala are no longer in existence, but
that such must have existed is a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>An explanation of the <span class="lowercase smcap">CHANGE OF HOST</span> so frequent in parasites
is more difficult than that of their descent. R. Leuckart is of opinion
that the present intermediate hosts, which belong principally to the
lower animals, were the original hosts of the parasites, and fostered<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
both their larval and adult stages. It was only in course of time that
the original hosts sank to the position of intermediate hosts, the cause
for this alteration being that the development of parasites, especially
of the helminthes, through further development and differentiation
extended over a larger number of stages. The earlier stages remained
in their original hosts, but the later stages sought out other hosts
(higher animals). To prove this, Leuckart points out that the mature
stages of the helminthes, with but few exceptions, occur only in the
vertebrates which appeared later in the development of the animal
kingdom, while the great majority of intestinal worms of the lower
animals only represent young stages, which require transmission into
a vertebrate animal before they can become mature. The few
helminthes that attain maturity in the lower animals (<i>Aspidogaster</i>,
<i>Archigetes</i>) are therefore regarded by Leuckart as primitive forms,
and he compares them with the developmental stages of helminthes,
<i>Aspidogaster</i> with rediÃ¦, <i>Archigetes</i> with cysticercoids. He classes
the nematodes that become mature in the invertebrates with <i>AnguillulidÃ¦</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, with saprophagous nematodes from which the parasitic
species descend.</p>

<p>Leuckart therefore regards the change of hosts as secondary,
so does Sabatier. The latter, however, adduces other reasons for
this (lack of clinging organs and the necessity to develop them in an
intermediary stage); but in this connection he only considers the
Cestoda. In opposition to Leuckart, R. Moniez, however, is convinced
that the migrations of the helminthes, as well as the system
of intermediate hosts, represent the original order of things. Moniez
traces all Entozoa from saprophytes, but only a few of these were
able to settle directly in the intestine and there continue their
development. These are forms that at the present day still lack
an intermediate host, such as <i>Trichocephalus</i>, <i>Ascaris</i>, and <i>Oxyuris</i>.
In most other cases the embryos, however, consisted of such saprophytes
as were, in other respects, suitable to become parasites, but
were incapable of resisting the mechanical and chemical influences
of the intestinal contents. They were therefore obliged to leave the
intestine at once, and accomplished this by penetrating the intestinal
walls and burrowing in the tissues of their carriers. In this position,
assisted by the favourable conditions of nutrition, they could attain
a relatively high degree of development. Mechanical reasons prevented
a return to the intestines, where the eggs could be deposited.
Most of them doubtless died off as parasites, as also their young
stages do at present when they penetrate wrong hosts. Some of
them, nevertheless, passively reached the intestine of beasts of prey.
Many were destroyed in the process of mastication; for a small part,
however, there was the chance of reaching the intestine of a beast<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
of prey undamaged, and there, having become larger and more
capable of resistance, maturity was attained. By means of this incidental
coincidence of various favourable circumstances, these processes,
according to Moniez, have been established by heredity and
have become normal.</p>

<p>This is not the place to express an opinion either for or against
the various hypotheses advanced, but the existence of these diametrically
opposed views alone will show the great difficulty of the
question. Independently, however, it appears more natural to come
to the conclusion that parasitism, as well as change of hosts, were
gradual transitions.</p>

<h2><span class="ls01em">THE ANIMAL PARASITES OF MAN</span>.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="r10" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Man is one of those organisms in on on which a whole host of parasites find
conditions suitable for their existence: Protozoa, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda,
Acanthocephala, Hirudinea, and a large number of Arthropoda (Arachnida as well
as Insects) all include members which are parasites of man. These animals either
live on the external surface of the body or within the intestine and its appendages.
Other organs and systems are not quite free from foreign organisms&mdash;we are
acquainted with parasites in the skeletal system, in the circulatory system, in the
brain, in the muscles, in the excretory and genital organs, and even in the organs of
sense.</p>

<p>It is possible, and perhaps might be advantageous, to arrange and describe the
parasites of man according to the situations in which they are found (parasites of the
skin, intestinal parasites, etc.). Their description in the various stages of development
would, however, be disturbed when, as is generally the case, the different stages
are passed in different organs, and a work which treats more fully of the natural
history of the parasites than of the local disorders to which they give rise would
suffer thereby. It is, therefore, preferable to describe the parasites of man in their
systematic order, and to mention their different situations in man in describing each
species.</p></div>


<h3>A.&emsp;<b>PROTOZOA</b>,<br />
<span class="fs60">BY</span><br />
<span class="fs80">H.&nbsp;B. FANTHAM, M.A., D.Sc.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All those animal organisms which throughout their entire life never rise above
the unicellular stage, or merely form simple, loose colonies of similar unicellular
animals, are grouped under the term <i>Protozoa</i> (Goldfuss, 1820), as the simplest types
of animal life. All the vital functions of these, the lowest forms of animals, are
carried out by their body substance, the protoplasm (sarcode). Often particular
parts possess special functions, but the limits of a cell are never over-stepped
thereby. These special parts of the cell are called âcell-organsâ; recently they
have been termed âorganellÃ¦.â</p>

<p>The living protoplasm has the appearance of a finely granular, viscid substance
which, as a rule, when not surrounded by dense investing membranes or skeletons,
exhibits a distinct kind of movement, which has been termed amÅboid. According
to the species, processes of different forms and varying numbers called pseudopodia
are protruded and withdrawn, and with their assistance these tiny organisms glide
along&mdash;it might almost be said flow along&mdash;over the surface. In most Protozoa two
layers of cytoplasm may be recognised, and distinguished by their appearance and
structure, namely, the superficially situated, viscid, and quite hyaline ectosarc or
ectoplasm, and the more fluid and always granular endosarc or endoplasm, which
is entirely enveloped by the ectoplasm. The two layers have different functions; the
movements originate from the ectoplasm, which also undoubtedly fulfils the functions
of breathing, introduction of food and excretion. The endoplasm, which in some forms
(Radiolaria) is separated from the ectoplasm by a membrane, undertakes the digestion<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
of the food. To this distribution of functions between the various layers of cytoplasm
is due the development of particular cellular organs, such as the appearance
of cilia, flagella, suctorial tubules (in the Suctoria) and the myophan striations, which
are contractile parts of the ectoplasm in Infusoria and Gregarines. In many cases
(Flagellata, Ciliata), an area is differentiated for the ingestion of food (oral part,
cytostome) to which there is often added a straight or curved opening (cytopharynx),
through which the food reaches the endoplasm. The indigestible residue is either cast
off through the oral part or excreted by a special anal part (cytopyge). In rare
cases, structures sensitive to light, the so-called pigment or eye spots are developed,
<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Euglena</i>. In the case of Infusoria the endoplasm circulates slowly, and
agglomerations of fluids (food vacuoles) sometimes appear around each bolus of
food; in these vacuoles the food is digested under the action of certain materials
(ferments). Even in the lowliest Protozoa fluids to be excreted are, as a rule,
gathered into one, or, more rarely, several contractile vacuoles, which regularly
discharge their contents. This action, however, is to a certain extent governed
by the temperature of the surrounding medium. In some Infusoria a tube-like
channel in the cytoplasm is joined to the contractile vacuole which usually occupies
a certain position; this forms a sort of excretory duct, and there are also supply-canals
leading to these organellÃ¦.</p>

<p>Very frequently various substances are deposited in the endoplasm, such as fatty
granules, drops of oil, pigment granules, bubbles of gas or crystals. More solid
skeletal substances are secreted in or on the ectoplasm. To the latter belong the
cuticle of the Sporozoa and Infusoria, the chalky shells containing one or several
chambers of the Foraminifera, the siliceous and very ornamental framework of the
Radiolaria, and the chitinous coat of many Flagellata, Infusoria, etc. Some forms
make use of foreign bodies found in their surroundings, such as grains of sand, to
construct their protective coverings.</p>

<p>The food often consists of small animal or vegetable organisms and of organic
waste; it is usually introduced <i>in toto</i> into the endoplasm. On the other hand, the
Suctoria extract nourishment from their prey by means of their tentacles. Many
parasitic species also ingest solid food, others feed by endosmosis.</p>

<p>In all cases one nucleus at least is present. It is true that the existence of non-nucleated
Protozoa, the so-called <i>Monera</i>, is still insisted upon, but some of these
have already proved to be nucleated, and the presence of nuclei in the others will no
doubt be established. Very often the number of nuclei increases considerably, but
these multinucleate stages are always preceded by uninucleate stages. In the
Infusoria, in addition to the larger or principal nucleus (macronucleus) there is
usually a smaller reproductive nucleus (micronucleus). This dualism of the nuclear
apparatus is considered by some to be general, and usually to appear first at the
onset of reproduction.</p>

<p>The form and structure of the nucleus vary greatly in different species. There
are elongate, kidney-shaped, or even branched nuclei as well as spherical or oval
ones. In addition to vesicular nuclei with a distinct karyosome and incidentally
also with a nuclear membrane, homogeneous and more solid formations are
frequently encountered. The nuclei are always differentiated from the protoplasm
by their reactions, particularly in regard to certain stains.</p>

<p>In many Protozoa an extra-nuclear mass, sometimes compact, sometimes diffuse,
arises from or near the nucleus. This mass, whose staining reactions resemble those
of the nucleus, is termed the chromidial apparatus. On the dualistic hypothesis, two
varieties of chromidia occur, one originating from the vegetative nucleus (macronucleus),
being chromidia in the restricted sense, the other derived from the
reproductive or micronucleus being termed sporetia. Chromidia consist of altered
(? katabolic) nuclear material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span></p>

<p>The nucleus plays the same part in the life of the single celled organisms as it
does in the cells of the Metazoa and Metaphyta. It appears to influence in a certain
manner all, or at least most, of the processes of life, such as motility, regeneration,
growth, and generally also digestion. Its principal influence, however, is exercised
in the propagation of the cells, as this is always brought about by the nucleus.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">PROPAGATION</span> of the Protozoa is effected either by division or by means of
direct budding. In division, which is preceded by direct or indirect (mitotic)
division of the nucleus, the body separates into two, several, or even a great many
segments. In this process the entire substance of the body is involved, or a small
residual fragment may be left, which does not undergo further division and finally
perishes. In the budding method of multiplication a large number of buds are
formed, either on the surface or in the interior of the organism. Where divisions or
buddings follow one another rapidly, without the segments separating immediately
after their production, numerous forms develop, which are often unlike the parental
forms, and these are termed swarm spores or spores. Divisions imperfectly
accomplished lead to the formation of protozoal colonies.</p>

<p>Sometimes encystment<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> takes place previous to division. Frequently, also,
sexual processes appear, such as the union of two similar (isogamous) or dissimilar
(anisogamous) individuals. In the latter case sexual dimorphism occurs, with the
formation of males (microgametes) and of females (macrogametes). The union may
be permanent (copulation), the process being comparable with the fertilisation of the
ovum by a spermatozoon. On the other hand, attachment may be transient (conjugation)
when, after the exchange of portions of the nucleus, the couple separate,
to multiply independently of each other. Sometimes there is an <span class="lowercase smcap">ALTERNATION OF
GENERATIONS</span>, as there may be several methods of propagation combined in the
same species, either direct multiplication, conjugation, or copulation being practised;
the different generations may thus, in certain cases, be unlike morphologically.</p>

<p>Protozoa inhabit salt water as well as fresh water; they are also found on land
in very damp places, and invade animals as parasites.</p></div>


<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Classification of the Protozoa.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Class I.</i>&mdash;<b>Sarcodina</b> (<i>Rhizopoda</i>). Protozoa, the body substance of which forms
pseudopodia; many of them are capable of developing chitinous, chalky, or siliceous
coverings or skeletal structures, which, however, permit the protrusion of the
pseudopodia either over the entire periphery or at certain points. They possess one
nucleus or several.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><i>Order 1.</i>&mdash;<i>AmÅbina</i> (Lobosa) naked or with a simple shell, sometimes formed
of a foreign substance; the pseudopodia may be lobose or finger-shaped;
there may be a contractile vacuole; generally only one nucleus. They
live in fresh or salt water, in the soil, and also parasitically.</p>

<p><i>Order 2.</i>&mdash;<i>Foraminifera</i> (Reticularia). Mostly provided with a calcareous
shell, usually consisting of several chambers, and allowing the protrusion
of the pseudopodia either at the periphery or only at the opening. The
pseudopodia are filamentous and frequently anastomosed; there is no
contractile vacuole; there are usually several nuclei. Mostly marine.</p>

<p><i>Order 3.</i>&mdash;<i>Heliozoa.</i> Naked, or with a chitinous or simple radial siliceous
skeleton; the pseudopodia are filamentous, and are frequently supported<span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
by firmer axes, which exhibit no tendency to anastomosis; there is a
contractile vacuole; one or several nuclei. Live in fresh water.</p>

<p><i>Order 4.</i>&mdash;<i>Radiolaria</i>. The body has radially-disposed filamentous pseudopodia,
and the nucleus is hidden in the central capsule; there is almost
always a siliceous framework, consisting of pieces arranged radially,
tangentially, or lattice-like; there is no contractile vacuole, but fluid-containing
hydrostatic vacuoles are present in the peripheral protoplasm.
Marine.</p></div>

<p><i>Class II.</i>&mdash;<b>Mastigophora</b> (<i>Flagellata</i>). Protozoa with one or several long
flagella used for locomotion and for acquiring food; in stationary forms their only
function is to take in food. Cytostome and contractile vacuole may be present.
May be either naked or provided with protective coverings; one or more nuclei.
They live either in fresh or salt water, or may be parasitic.</p>

<p>This class is again divided into several sub-classes and orders, of which only the
Euflagellata, with the Protomonadina and Polymastigoda are of interest here.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i>&mdash;<b>Sporozoa.</b> Protozoa that only live parasitically in the cells, tissues,
or organs of other animals. They ingest liquid food by osmosis; the surface of the
body is covered with an ectoplasmic layer, or cuticle; they have no cilia in the adult
state, but may form pseudopodia. Flagella occur, but only on the male propagating
individuals. There may be one or numerous nuclei, but no contractile vacuole.
Propagation by means of spores, mostly provided with sporocysts, is characteristic.</p>

<p class="ml1hi4"><i>Sub-class</i> 1.&mdash;<b>Telosporidia.</b> These are usually of constant form, rarely amÅboid;
they are uninucleate in the mature state; they live within host cells in the
first stage. Spore-formation occurs at the end of the life-cycle.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><i>Order 1.</i>&mdash;<i>Gregarinida.</i> Body of a constant, usually elongate form, surrounded
by a cuticle. In the early stage they lead an intracellular existence; in
the mature stage they live within the intestine or body cavity of invertebrate
animals, especially the Arthropoda, and, like intestinal parasites,
are provided with clinging organs. Copulation usually isogamous;
the spores have coats (chlamydospores) and usually contain several
minute germs (sporozoites).</p>

<p><i>Order 2.</i>&mdash;<i>Coccidiidea.</i> Body of uniform spherical or oval shape: they lead
an intracellular life, but are not freely motile in cavities of the body.
Fertilization is anisogamous; the spores have coats or shells (sporocysts),
and usually contain several sporozoites. Exhibit alternation of generations.</p>

<p><i>Order 3.</i>&mdash;<i>HÃ¦mosporidia.</i> Parasites of the blood corpuscles of vertebrate
animals; they exhibit amÅboid movement; fertilization is anisogamous;
many present alternation of generations and hosts; spores naked.</p>
</div>

<p class="ml1hi4"><i>Sub-class 2.</i>&mdash;<b>Neosporidia.</b> They are multinucleate when adult, and the form of
the body varies exceedingly (often amÅboid); spore-formation commences
before the completion of growth.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><i>Order 1.</i>&mdash;<i>Myxosporidia.</i> The spores have valvular coats, with or without
caudal appendages, with two, rarely four, polar capsules. They live free
in such organs as the gall or urinary bladder, but are chiefly found in
connective tissue. They occur especially in fishes.</p>

<p><i>Order 2.</i>&mdash;<i>Microsporidia.</i> Spores with coats or sporocysts; no caudal
appendage, with one polar capsule. They usually live in the tissues of
Arthropoda.</p>

<p><i>Order 3.</i>&mdash;<i>Sarcosporidia.</i> Elongate parasites of the muscular fibres of
amniotic vertebrates, on rare occasions they occur also in the connective
tissue; the spores, which are kidney or sickle-shaped, are naked and
apparently have no obvious polar capsule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Order 4.</i>&mdash;<i>Haplosporidia.</i> Simple organisms, forming simple spores; they
occur in Rotifers, PolychÃ¦tes, Fish and Man.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Class IV.</i>&mdash;<b>Infusoria</b> (<i>Ciliata</i>). The body is generally uniform in shape, with
cilia and contractile vacuole, frequently also with cytostome; usually has macro-
and micro-nucleus; live free in water and also parasitically.</p>

<p>The orders <i>Holotricha</i>, <i>Heterotricha</i>, <i>Oligotricha</i>, <i>Hypotricha</i> and <i>Peritricha</i>
are classified according to the arrangement of the cilia.</p>

<p><i>Class V.</i>&mdash;<b>Suctoria.</b> Bodies with suctorial tubes, contractile vacuoles, macro-
and micro-nucleus, no cytostome. They generally invade aquatic animals as cavity
parasites, yet also attack plants; early stage ciliated. Live sometimes as parasites
on Infusoria. [The Suctoria are frequently regarded as a sub-class of the Infusoria.]</p>

<p>The Protozoa and Protophyta are sometimes united under the term <i>Protista</i>
(Haeckel, 1866). The SpirochÃ¦tes are Protists (see pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_114">114</a>â128).</p></div>

Order. <b>AmÅbina</b>, Ehrenberg.<br />

A. <b>Human Intestinal AmÅbÃ¦.</b></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first record of the occurrence of amÅba-like organisms in the human intestine,
that is, in intestinal evacuations, was that of Lambl (1859); nevertheless, the case
was not quite conclusive, as the occurrence of testaceous amÅbÃ¦ of fresh water
(<i>Arcella</i>, <i>Difflugia</i>) was also reported. In 1870 Lewis found amÅbÃ¦ associated with
disorders of the large intestine in patients in Calcutta. A year later Cunningham
reported from the same locality that he had observed on eighteen occasions, in one
hundred examinations of dejecta from cholera patients, colourless bodies with amÅboid
movements, which became encysted and multiplied by fission. The daughter forms
were said to be capable of dividing again, but they might also remain in contact.
Contractile vacuoles were not noticed. The same bodies were observed also in
simple diarrhÅa (twenty-eight cases out of one hundred.)</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;<i>AmÅba coli</i>, LÃ¶sch, in the intestinal mucus. (After LÃ¶sch.)</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The case reported by LÃ¶sch in 1875 attracted more attention. It was that of
a peasant, aged 24, who came from the province of Archangel. He was admitted<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
into Eichwaldâs clinic at Petrograd with symptoms of dysentery. In the discharges
containing blood and pus, LÃ¶sch found amÅbÃ¦ in large numbers. When
at rest these amÅbÃ¦ measured from 20&nbsp;Âµ to 35&nbsp;Âµ; in a state of movement their length
might extend up to 60&nbsp;Âµ (fig.&nbsp;1). The pseudopodia appeared only singly, and,
since they were hyaline (ectoplasmic), were thus distinguished from the markedly
granular endoplasm that enclosed a spherical nucleus of from 5&nbsp;Âµ to 7&nbsp;Âµ in diameter.
One or more non-contractile vacuoles were present. Quinine enemata had the
effect of making the amÅbÃ¦ disappear from the fÃ¦ces and thus causing the diarrhÅa
to abate. Four months after admission the patient died from the results of
intercurrent pneumonia. At the autopsy ulceration of the large intestine was found,
especially in the lower parts. LÃ¶sch connected the amÅbÃ¦ with the ulcerations by
experiments made on four dogs by injecting them with recently passed stools
(<i>per os et anum</i>). Eight days after the last injection numerous amÅbÃ¦ were found
in the fÃ¦ces of one of these dogs; eighteen days after the injection the animal
was killed. The mucosa of the rectum was inflamed, covered with blood-stained
mucus and ulcerated in three places. Numbers of amÅbÃ¦ were found both in
the pus of the ulcers and in the mucus. The three other dogs remained healthy.
From these observations LÃ¶sch concluded that the species of amÅba described by him
as <i>AmÅba coli</i> could not be regarded as the primary cause of the disease, but that it
was certainly capable of increasing a lesion of the large intestine already present,
or at least of preventing its healing.</p>

<p>B. Grassi (1879) found in the stools of healthy as well as in those of diarrhÅic
patients from various localities in Northern Italy, amÅbÃ¦ similar to those discovered
by LÃ¶sch. As this was of frequent occurrence, the pathogenicity could not be
definitely established. Normand, formerly naval surgeon at Hong-Kong, observed
numerous amÅbÃ¦ in the dejecta of two patients suffering from colitis.</p>

<p>Many further investigations, which cannot be quoted in detail, showed not only
that intestinal amÅbÃ¦ were widely distributed in man, but indicated with greater
certainty their rÃ´le as agents of dysentery. The Commission sent out by the German
Government in the year 1883 to investigate cholera in India and Egypt&mdash;whose
members discovered the cholera bacillus&mdash;also collected information with regard to
dysentery. In five cases of dysentery examined <i>post mortem</i> at Alexandria, with
the exception of one case in which ulceration of the colon had already cicatrized or
was approaching cicatrization, R. Koch found amÅbÃ¦ as well as bacteria in sections
from the base of the ulcers, although such had previously escaped notice in examination
of the dejecta. Encouraged by these results, Kartulis (1885), who had discovered
amÅba-like bodies in the stools of patients suffering from intestinal complaints at
Alexandria, continued his investigations. The results, obtained from more than 500
cases, gave rise to the theory that typical dysentery was caused by amÅbÃ¦ as were
also the liver-abscesses that often accompany it. Kartulis supported his theory not
only by the regular occurrence of amÅbÃ¦ in the stools of dysenteric patients and
their absence in other diseases, and by the occurrence of the parasites in ulcers of the
large intestine and in the pus from liver-abscesses, but also by experiments which
he performed on cats. These were infected by injection <i>per anum</i> of stool material
rich in amÅbÃ¦ from subjects of dysentery. The infection took place also when
amÅba-containing, but bacteria-free, pus from liver-abscesses was used. It has been
objected that the infection of man with <i>AmÅba coli</i>, as the dysenteric amÅbÃ¦ were
then generally designated, does not take place <i>per anum</i> but <i>per os</i>. This difficulty,
however, diminished in proportion as the encysted states of amÅbÃ¦ (fig.&nbsp;2), long
known in the case of other Protozoa, became understood. The infection of man
(Calandruccio, 1890) and of cats (Quincke and Roos) succeeded solely when material
containing such stages was used. AmÅbÃ¦ introduced into the intestine multiply
there by fission (Harris, 1894). However, this theory, to which various other authors<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
gave support on the grounds of their own observations, encountered opposition. Thus
it was established that amÅbÃ¦ were not found in patients in every place where
dysentery was endemic, or else they were much rarer than was expected. Further,
amÅbÃ¦ were present in the most varied kinds of intestinal diseases, both of infective
and non-infective characters. Also they were present in quite healthy persons.</p>

<p>Moreover, for various reasons, infection experiments on animals failed to supply
proof, and finally a bacterium was discovered (Shiga, 1898) to be the excitant of one
form of dysentery. Agglutination attested the specific part played by this organism,
as it was produced by the blood serum of a person suffering from or recovered from
dysentery, but not by the serum of one who was uninfected. Bacillary dysentery
consequently was a distinct entity. The final step to be taken was to decide whether
there was a specific amÅbic enteritis (amÅbic dysentery or amÅbiasis, according to
Musgrave).</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This question should decidedly be regarded from the positive point of view.
It is intimately connected with another, namely, whether there are not several species
of intestinal amÅbÃ¦. The possibility of this had already been recognized. In
addition to the <i>AmÅba coli</i> LÃ¶sch, R. Blanchard distinguished yet another, <i>AmÅba
intestinalis</i>, and designated thereby the large amÅbÃ¦ described in the first communication
made by Kartulis; later on he stated the distinction between the species.
Councilman and Lafleur<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> (1891) considered the amÅba of dysentery to be <i>AmÅba coli</i>
LÃ¶sch and so re-named the species <i>AmÅba dysenteriÃ¦</i>. Kruse and Pasquale (1893)
employed the same nomenclature, but retained the old name <i>AmÅba coli</i> LÃ¶sch for
the non-infectious species. Quincke and Roos (1893) set forth three species: a
smaller species (25&nbsp;Âµ) finely granular, pathogenic for men and cats (<i>AmÅba coli</i>
LÃ¶sch); a larger species (40&nbsp;Âµ) coarsely granular, pathogenic for men but not for
cats (<i>A. coli mitis</i>); and a similar species non-pathogenic either for man or cat
(<i>A. intestini vulgaris</i>). Celli and Fiocca (1894â6) went still further, they distinguished:</p>

<p>(1) <i>AmÅba lobosa</i> variety <i>guttula</i> (= <i>A. guttula</i> Duj), variety <i>oblonga</i> (= <i>A. oblonga</i>
Schm.) and variety <i>coli</i> (= <i>A. coli</i> LÃ¶sch).</p>

<p>(2) <i>AmÅba spinosa</i> n. sp. occurring in the vagina as well as in the intestine of
human patients suffering from diarrhÅa and dysentery.</p>

<p>(3) <i>AmÅba diaphana</i> n. sp. found in the human intestine in cases of dysentery.</p>

<p>(4) <i>AmÅba vermicularis</i> Weisse, present in the vagina and in dysentery; and</p>

<p>(5) <i>AmÅba reticularis</i> n. sp. in dysentery.</p>

<p>Shiga distinguished two species; a larger pathogenic species with a somewhat
active movement, and a small harmless species with a somewhat sluggish movement.
Bowman mentions two varieties, Strong and Musgrave (1900) two species&mdash;the pathogenic
<i>AmÅba dysenteriÃ¦</i> and the non-pathogenic <i>AmÅba coli</i>; JÃ¤ger (1902) and
JÃ¼rgens (1902) mention at least two species. In the following year (1903) a work by
Schaudinn was published which marked a real advance. This, in conjunction with
the establishing of a special genus (<i>EndamÅba</i> or <i>EntamÅba</i>) for human intestinal
amÅbÃ¦ first by Leidy<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and then by Casagrandi and Barbagallo,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> for the time cleared
up the confused nomenclature, the old name <i>AmÅba coli</i> being retained for the<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
harmless intestinal amÅbÃ¦ of man, whereas the pathogenic species was designated
<i>EntamÅba histolytica</i>. The history of more recent work is incorporated in the
accounts of the entamÅbÃ¦ given below.</p></div>

<p>The amÅboid trophozoite, according to LÃ¶sch, measures 26&nbsp;Âµ to
30&nbsp;Âµ and upwards; according to Grassi 8&nbsp;Âµ to 22&nbsp;Âµ; according to
Schuberg 12&nbsp;Âµ to 26&nbsp;Âµ. A separation of the body substance into
ectoplasm and endoplasm is only perceived during movement. The
pseudopodia, which are generally only protruded singly, are broad
and rounded at the end (lobopodia) and are hyaline, while the
remainder of the body is granular. The ectoplasm is less refractile
than the rest of the cytoplasm; it also stains less intensely (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_1">1</a>),
and is best seen on protrusion of a pseudopodium. Red blood
corpuscles are rarely, if ever, found ingested in the cytoplasm.</p>

nucleate cysts. (After Castellani and Chalmers)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The nucleus is vesicular, and is spherical when inactive, measuring
5&nbsp;Âµ to 7&nbsp;Âµ, with a thick nuclear membrane. In the centre of the<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
nucleus is a chromatinic body or karyosome or sometimes several
small nuclear bodies formed of plastin and chromatin; the remaining
chromatin is arranged on the achromatic network in the form of fine
granules, especially thickly deposited on the nuclear membrane.</p>

<p><i>EntamÅba coli</i> lives as a commensal in the upper portion of the
large intestine, where the fÃ¦ces still possess a pulpy consistency.
With their concentration and change in reaction lower in the
bowel, the parasites either die or else if they are at a suitable stage of
development form resistant cysts. These cysts (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_2">2</a>) can be found
in great abundance in normal fÃ¦ces, as Grassi first observed. Slight
laxantia or intestinal diseases of any kind producing increased
peristalsis, however, show amÅbÃ¦ even in the unencysted condition,
provided that the person harbours intestinal amÅbÃ¦ generally. The
intensity of infection varies according to the locality; thus Schaudinn
found that 50 per cent. of the persons examined were infected with
harmless amÅbÃ¦ in East Prussia, 20 per cent. in Berlin and about 66
per cent. on the Austrian littoral.</p>

<p>The life-history (fig.&nbsp;3) of the parasite exhibits two phases:
(<i>a</i>) asexual multiplication in the intestine, either by binary fission or
by schizogony with formation of eight merozoites, and (<i>b</i>) sporogony
leading to the production of eight-nucleate cysts. Infection results
from ingestion of cysts. Only cysts with eight nuclei are infective.
The diameter of such cysts is about 15&nbsp;Âµ to 20&nbsp;Âµ.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are varying accounts of the details of the life-cycle of <i>EntamÅba coli</i> in its
different stages. Thus, regarding schizogony or multiple fission it was formerly
stated that the nucleus of the parent amÅba divided into eight portions, which after
dissolution of the nuclear membrane, passed outwards into the cytoplasm, which
segregated around each. Eight merozoites were thus produced. More recently the
process of schizogony has been considered to consist in the repeated division of the
nucleus into two, four, and finally eight nuclei (fig.&nbsp;3, <span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>-<span class="lowercase smcap">D</span>), and the formation of
eight merozoites or amÅbulÃ¦.</p>

<p>The process of encystment is initiated by the extrusion of all liquid and foreign
bodies from the protoplasm, which assumes a spherical form (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_4">4</a>, <span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>). The rounded
uninucleate amÅba then secretes a soft gelatinous coat, which finally differentiates
into a double contoured cyst wall in older cysts. According to Casagrandi and
Barbagallo, the size of the cyst varies from 8&nbsp;Âµ to 30&nbsp;Âµ, and averages about 15&nbsp;Âµ.
According to Schaudinn (1903) the cytological changes during cyst formation are as
follows. The nucleus of a rounded uninucleate form divides into two (fig.&nbsp;4, <span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>).
Each of these nuclei fragments into chromidia (fig.&nbsp;4, <span class="lowercase smcap">C</span>), some of which are absorbed,
while others reunite so that the cell becomes binucleate again. Each of these
nuclei, by a twice repeated division, produces three nuclei (fig.&nbsp;4, <span class="lowercase smcap">D</span>), the smaller
two of which degenerate and were regarded as reduction nuclei. There is a clear
zone or vacuole in the middle of the cyst during these maturation processes, dividing
the cyst into two halves. After the nuclear reduction the clear space disappears,
and each nucleus (termed by some a gamete nucleus) divides into two pronuclei
(fig.&nbsp;4, <span class="lowercase smcap">E</span>). The pronuclei of the pairs were said by Schaudinn to differ slightly.
Copulation occurs between pairs of unlike pronuclei, and is an example of autogamy
(fig.&nbsp;4, <span class="lowercase smcap">F</span>). When complete, each of the fusion nuclei (synkarya) divides twice, giving<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
rise first to four and finally to eight nuclei. Eight amÅbulÃ¦ are thus formed within
the cyst.</p>

<p>According to Hartmann and Whitmore (1911)<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>, however, autogamy does not
occur within the cysts of <i>E. coli.</i> They consider that eight small amÅbulÃ¦ are
formed (fig.&nbsp;3, <i>2</i>-<i>10</i>) which escape from the cyst and then conjugate in pairs
(fig.&nbsp;3, <i>10</i>-<i>12</i>), afterwards growing into a new generation of trophozoites.</p>

<p>Only some 10 to 20 per cent. of the cysts evacuated with the fÃ¦ces undergo the
full course of development, the majority perish previously. In old dry fÃ¦ces, only
cysts with eight nuclei are found, and it is these alone that cause the infection.</p>

<p><i>EntamÅba williamsi</i>, <i>E. bÃ¼tschlii</i>, <i>E. hartmanni</i> and <i>E. poleki</i> (Prowazek) are
probably only varieties of <i>E. coli</i>.</p></div>

</div>

<p>The principal feature distinguishing <i>EntamÅba coli</i> from <i>E.
histolytica</i> is the formation of eight-nucleate cysts by the former as
contrasted with the tetra-nucleate cysts of the latter. The cyst-wall of
<i>E. coli</i> is thicker than that of <i>E. histolytica</i> (<i>tetragena</i>). Further, <i>E. coli</i>
does not usually ingest red blood corpuscles, nor are âchromidial
blocksâ present inside its cyst (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_40">40</a>).</p>

<p>According to Chatton and Lalung-Bonnaire<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> (1912) the entamÅbÃ¦
of vertebrates should be placed in a separate genus <i>LÃ¶schia</i>, as they
differ in their life-history from <i>E. blattÃ¦</i>, the type species of <i>EntamÅba</i>.
Leidy (1879), however, named the genus <i>EndamÅba</i>, but further
researches are necessary on biological variation among these
organisms.</p>

<p>The average size of the amÅboid trophozoite is 25&nbsp;Âµ to 30&nbsp;Âµ.
In fÃ¦ces diluted with salt solution the amÅbÃ¦ swell to 40&nbsp;Âµ and more.
There is sometimes separation of the body substance into a strongly
refractile vitreous ectoplasm and a corneous endoplasm, pronounced<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
even in repose, although the former is not equally thick at all parts of
the periphery. In the endoplasm generally there are numerous foreign
bodies (bacteria, epithelial cells, colourless and red blood corpuscles
(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_6">6</a>), and occasionally living flagellates of the intestine). The
nucleus is 4&nbsp;Âµ to 6&nbsp;Âµ in diameter, and may be difficult to recognize
because it is sometimes weakly refractile and poor in chromatin. Its
shape is slightly variable; it is usually excentric, sometimes wholly
peripheral at the limit of the two parts of the body. Vacuoles are not
present in quite fresh specimens, but appear later. In the study of
<i>E. histolytica</i>, the morphological characters of the trophozoite or
vegetative stage of the organism formerly separated as <i>E. tetragena</i>
(figs.&nbsp;5, 6, <a href="#Fig_8">8</a><i>a</i>) must be considered (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_38">38</a>).</p>

<p>The history of the development of these species, which give rise to amÅbic
enteritis as distinguished from bacillary dysentery, was formerly not so well known
as that of <i>E. coli</i>. Upon being introduced into cats (<i>per anum</i>) dysenteric amÅbÃ¦
provoke symptoms similar to those in man. In the
latter, besides metastatic liver abscesses, abscesses
of the lungs, and, according to Kartulis, cerebral
abscesses are occasionally produced. Marchoux
(1899) states that when the disease has lasted for
some time liver abscesses are produced in cats also.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the large intestine of infected cats the
amÅbÃ¦ creep over the epithelium, and here and
there they force the epithelial cells apart, as well
as removing them or pushing them in front of
them; the amÅbÃ¦ thus insert themselves into the
narrowest fissures. They penetrate also into the
glands through the epithelium, and thence into
the connective tissue of the mucosa. Intestinal
and glandular epithelia perish under the influence
of these parasites: the cells are pushed aside,
fall to pieces or are absorbed by the amÅbÃ¦. In the connective tissue of the
mucosa the amÅbÃ¦ migrate further, and often accumulate above the muscles.
Finally they rupture this and force their way into the submucosa. In cats,<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
apparently, the penetration is not so great as in men, according to Kruse and
Pasquale. During their migration the parasites also gain access to the lymph-follicles
of the wall of the intestine, which become swollen and commence
to suppurate; follicular abscesses arise and after their rupture follicular ulcers.
The diseased patches in the mucosa are markedly hyperÃ¦mic and numerous hÃ¦morrhages
are set up. Roos and Harris state that the amÅbÃ¦ also penetrate into
the blood-vessels (fig.&nbsp;7) and this explains the occurrence of metastatic abscesses.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
The whole submucosa is severely swollen at the diseased spot and undergoes small-celled
infiltration in the neighbourhood of the colonies of amÅbÃ¦. From these
findings JÃ¼rgens (1902) draws the conclusion<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> which is followed here, that the amÅbÃ¦
are causative agents of the enteritis of cats, which disease is well defined, both
pathologically and anatomically. Subsequent researches confirm the experience of
earlier authors; great precautions were taken to exclude errors, hence, as with
Gross and Harris, no exception can be taken to their results. The inoculation
material was derived from soldiers who suffered from amÅbic enteritis in China
and who were admitted into the garrison hospital at Berlin. In order to be<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
independent of the patients themselves, transmission experiments from cat to cat
were performed, after the first experiments on cats yielded positive results. This
was also effected by rectal feeding as employed by earlier workers. Such appeared
necessary in order to prevent the evacuation of the inoculation material <i>per anum</i>,
as well as to avoid the employment of morphia and ether narcosis. Forty-six
cats were used for the experiments. Ten cats received tested stools containing
motile amÅbÃ¦ from soldiers suffering from amÅbic enteritis contracted in China.
Sixteen other cats received stools from cats infected by inoculation. All the animals
sickened and suffered from the disease. Five cats received dejecta from human
amÅbic enteritis in which, however, no <i>motile</i> amÅbÃ¦ were present. Thirteen cats
received stools from soldiers who suffered from bacillary dysentery. None of the
latter cats took the complaint and none showed changes in the large intestine upon
sectioning. The injection of various bacteria, obtained from a stool of amÅbic
enteritis pathogenic to cats, remained without result in both the cats employed for
this experiment. Lastly, two cats, which had been kept with those artificially
infected, were taken ill spontaneously and suffered from the disease. In the opinion
of Harris, who ascertained the harmless nature of bacteria derived from the
intestinal flora containing dysenteric amÅbÃ¦, young dogs are capable of being
infected.</p>

<p>Within the large intestine an active increase of <i>EntamÅba histolytica</i> must occur.
Nevertheless, JÃ¼rgens did not definitely find changes that might be interpreted in this
sense. Schaudinn (1903) observed division and gemmation <i>in vivo</i>. Both processes,
in which the nucleus divides by amitosis, can only be distinguished by the fact that
the daughter individuals are similar in binary fission but dissimilar in gemmation,
whether they make their appearance singly or in greater numbers. Schizogony,
resulting in the formation of eight individuals, which is so characteristic for <i>EntamÅba
coli</i>, was not observed. (But schizogony, into four merozoites, is now known
to occur. Gemmation processes are apparently degenerative.)</p>

<p>Resistant stages, which serve for transmission to other hosts, are according to
Schaudinn<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> first formed when the diseased portions commence to heal, or more
accurately, the recovery commences when the vegetative increase of the amÅbÃ¦ in the
intestine discontinues. The so-called spores of <i>E. histolytica</i> were distinguished very
definitely from those of <i>E. coli</i>; they were said to consist of spheres of only 3 to
7&nbsp;Âµ in diameter, which were surrounded by a double membrane, at first colourless, but
becoming a light brownish yellow colour after a few hours, and possessing a protoplasmic
content containing chromidia. They were said to arise by fragments of chromatin
passing outwards from the nucleus of the amÅba into the surrounding cytoplasm
(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_9">9</a>, <i>a</i>) and undergoing so marked an increase that finally the whole cytoplasm
became filled with chromidia. The remainder of the nucleus underwent degeneration
and became extruded. On the surface of the cytoplasm there then arose small
protuberances containing chromidia. These processes had been observed in the
living organisms. They gradually divided and separated from membranes which later
became yellow. The remainder of the amÅba perished. Craig<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> had also seen phases
of this process of development. It must be remarked that, according to recent
researches, these processes of exogenous sporulation are degenerative in character (see
p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_41">41</a>). The small spores may be fungi. The âsporulationâ processes are only mentioned
here as a warning. They are now only of historic interest. By means of an
experiment made on a cat, Schaudinn ascertained that ingestion of permanent cysts,
which resist desiccation, is the cause of the infection. The animal took food containing
dry fÃ¦ces with amÅba cysts; these fÃ¦ces came from a patient suffering from amÅbic<span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
enteritis in China. On the evening of the third day the cat evacuated blood-stained
mucous fÃ¦ces which contained large numbers of typical <i>EntamÅba histolytica</i>. On
the fourth day after the infection the animal experimented upon died, and the large
intestine showed the changes previously stated.</p>

<p><i>E. histolytica</i> also is found in the large intestine. This was originally shown
to be the case by Kartulis, and the fact has recently been confirmed from many
quarters. It is also present in the metastatic abscesses of which it is the cause
(<i>cf.</i> among other authors, Rogers, <i>Brit. Med. Journ.</i>, 1902, ii, No. 2,177, p.&nbsp;844; and

<p>It should lastly be pointed out in this connection that mixed infections also take
place. For instance, in addition to <i>E. histolytica</i>, <i>E. coli</i>, and, under certain circumstances,
flagellates may be found together. In the same way <i>E. coli</i> may come
under observation even in bacillary dysentery. On the other hand, Schaudinn
stated that in cases of dysentery endemic in Istria, <i>EntamÅba coli</i>, if it had hitherto
been present, disappeared, to return again after recovery from the illness.</p></div>

<p class="spec">(<i>EntamÅba tetragena</i>, Viereck, 1907.)</p>

<p>This amÅba must now be considered to be a part of the lifecycle
of <i>EntamÅba histolytica</i>, in fact a very important part of that
cycle, especially in its tetranucleate cystic stages.</p>

<p>This organism, the so-called <i>EntamÅba tetragena</i>, may occur in
the human intestine in cases of amÅbic dysentery, especially in
mild or chronic cases. It was discovered by Viereck in 1907 in
patients suffering from dysentery contracted in Africa. Soon afterwards
an independent description was published by Hartmann, who
called the amÅba <i>E. africana</i>. It was also studied by Bensen and
Werner. Recently (1912â13) much work has been published on
this amÅba by Darling and others; in this way its relationship to
Schaudinnâs <i>E. histolytica</i> has been made known.</p>

<p>In general morphology it somewhat resembles <i>EntamÅba coli</i>, and<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
its discoverer at first mistook it for a variety of that species. According
to Hartmann, a distinct ectoplasm is only clearly visible when
a pseudopodium is protruded (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_5">5</a>). The granular endoplasm may
contain ingested red blood corpuscles (fig.&nbsp;6). The large, round
nucleus is visible in the fresh state (fig.&nbsp;8, <i>a</i>). So-called chromidial
masses (? crystalloidal substances) may occur in the cytoplasm.</p>

and four nuclei respectively, and showing chromidial blocks. Ã&nbsp;2,000. (After Hartmann.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Some investigators, as Hartmann,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> lay stress on the internal
structure of the nucleus (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_8">8</a>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>), best seen in preparations fixed wet
and stained with iron-hÃ¦matoxylin. The nucleus is limited by a well-marked
nuclear membrane, on the inside of which granules or nodules
of chromatin may occur. There is a karyosome, which, in successfully
stained specimens, shows, at times, a central dot called a
centriole. (The nucleus of <i>EntamÅba coli</i> does not contain such a
centriole.) However, the structure of the nucleus varies at different
periods during the life-cycle.</p>

<p>The diameter of the trophozoites or vegetative forms (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_8">8</a>, <i>a</i>) is
variously given as from 20&nbsp;Âµ to 40&nbsp;Âµ. Multiplication proceeds by
binary fission and also by schizogony into four merozoites.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>Reproduction takes place by endogenous encystment (fig.&nbsp;9, <i>d</i>-<i>f</i>),
which is preceded by nuclear division into two, reduction and then
autogamy. The interpretation of the latter phenomenon as autogamy<span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>
is disputed by some authors. The round cysts, which may measure
12&nbsp;Âµ to 15&nbsp;Âµ in diameter, contain four nuclei, together with darkly
staining masses of various shapes, the so-called âchromidial blocksâ
(fig.&nbsp;9, <i>f</i>). The cyst-wall of <i>E. histolytica</i> (<i>tetragena</i>) is thinner than
that of <i>E. coli</i>, and the diameter of the cyst is rather less. <i>E. histolytica</i>
has not yet been cultivated.</p>

<p>Infection in man occurs by way of the mouth by the ingestion
of cysts. A patient showing acute symptoms of dysentery is not
usually infective, for he is merely harbouring the large trophozoites,
which, by experiment, have been shown not to be infective to animals
(kittens) when administered by the mouth. The stools of recovered
patients may still contain cysts, and they may thus act as cyst-carriers
or reservoirs of disease by infecting water and soil. The stools of such
cyst-carriers are often solid, and so cysts of <i>E. histolytica</i> (<i>tetragena</i>)
are easily overlooked. Mathis (1913)<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> points out that healthy carriers
of <i>E. histolytica</i> may be found; 8 per cent. of the natives of Tonkin
examined by him were healthy carriers of cysts.</p>

<p>In return cases, or prolonged untreated cases of entamÅbic
dysentery, a generation of smaller trophozoites is associated with, or
replaces the larger ones. In stools they are frequently refractile and
consequently stain slowly <i>intra vitam</i>. These trophozoites are the
âsmaller, senile, or pre-cyst generationâ of Darling. This pre-cyst
generation is characterized by the presence of blocks of crystalloidal
substance in the cytoplasm, and by the possession of a prominent,
densely stainable karyosome. Darling believes this generation to
be the same as that described by Elmassian as <i>EntamÅba minuta</i>.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>Walker,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Darling,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Wenyon<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and others believe that <i>EntamÅba
histolytica</i>, which was only seen by Schaudinn in a single case, that of
a Chinaman, is really <i>E. tetragena</i>. Darling states that if the published
illustrations of <i>E. histolytica</i> and of <i>E. tetragena</i> are collected from the
literature and compared, it will be seen that the writers have been
calling <i>E. histolytica</i> the large trophozoites seen in dysenteric stools.
These large trophozoites frequently display no karyosome, but they
can be demonstrated as <i>E. tetragena</i> by animal inoculation, or by the
history of the case. On the other hand, the illustrations of <i>E. tetragena</i>
show that the authors have been dealing with the small generation or
reduced forms (â<i>E. minuta</i>â), which are the direct descendants of the
large trophozoites. If kittens are inoculated rectally with dysenteric
material containing large trophozoites, the strain may be carried in
successive kittens for four to six transfers. If, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
kittens are inoculated rectally with small trophozoites of the pre-cyst
generation, the transmission cannot be carried through more than one
or two kittens. Wenyon has succeeded in maintaining <i>E. tetragena</i> in
kittens for several generations.</p>

<p>In some of the preparations from the last remove, pathological
forms of the trophozoites may be seen. These show abnormal forms
of budding, especially peripherally, such as have been described by
Schaudinn and by Craig as characteristic of <i>E. histolytica</i>. Schaudinnâs
small peripheral, exogenous buds and cysts are thus explained. Craig
has latterly changed his views.</p>

<p>Further, Darling states that <i>tetragena</i> cysts fed by the mouth to
kittens produce bowel lesions in which trophozoites having the characters
of <i>E. tetragena</i>, <i>E. histolytica</i> and <i>E. nipponica</i> (Koidzumi) occur.</p>

<p>In view of the work of recent observers, the peculiar exogenous
encystment which Schaudinn made characteristic of <i>EntamÅba
histolytica</i> has been shown to be due to degenerative changes in senile
races of the amÅba. <i>E. histolytica</i> and <i>E. tetragena</i> are one and the
same species, and its trophozoite is subject to variation. According
to some observers the <i>histolytica</i> type of nucleus&mdash;described by
Schaudinn as being poor in chromatin and not easily seen in the
fresh state&mdash;occurs frequently in patients with severe symptoms of
dysentery; on the other hand, the <i>tetragena</i> type of nucleus&mdash;round
and easily seen in the fresh state&mdash;may occur in cases presenting slight
dysenteric symptoms. Intermediate types of nuclei are seen. The
name of this species, the principal pathogenic amÅba of man, must
then be <i>E. histolytica</i> by priority. The cystic stages of <i>E. histolytica</i> are
those first recorded by Viereck and formerly described as <i>E. tetragena</i>.
The geographical distribution of <i>E. histolytica</i> is wide.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Nocâs EntamÅba</b> (1909).</p>

<p>A species of EntamÅba was cultivated by Noc<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> in 1909 from cysts
derived from liver abscesses, from dysenteric stools and from the
water supply of Saigon, Cochin China. He cultivated it in association
with bacteria. It is pathogenic. It has been considered allied
to <i>E. histolytica</i>, and shows internal segmentation or schizogony. It
exhibits polymorphism. This amÅba has been found by Greig and
Wells (1911) in cases of dysentery in India. It is an important
organism and requires further investigation.</p>

<p>Certain other EntamÅbÃ¦<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> have been described at various times from
the intestinal tract of man. Probably most, if not all, of these are not
good species and in some cases much more information is needed.</p>

<p><i>EntamÅba tropicalis</i> (Lesage, 1908). This parasite is said to be<span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
non-pathogenic, and to occur in the intestine of man in the tropics.
It has a general resemblance to <i>E. coli</i>, but forms small cysts (6&nbsp;Âµ to
10&nbsp;Âµ in diameter). The nucleus of the cyst is said to break up into a
variable number of daughter nuclei, from three to thirteen having
been noted. Lesage states that it is culturable in symbiosis with
bacteria. It is probably a variety of <i>E. coli</i>, if not a cultural amÅba.</p>

<p><i>EntamÅba hominis</i> (Walker, 1908) has a diameter of 6&nbsp;Âµ to 15&nbsp;Âµ. A
contractile vacuole is present. Encystment is total, and small cysts are
formed. It is culturable. The original strain, now lost, was obtained
from an autopsy in Boston Hospital. This organism is probably
a cultural amÅba.</p>

<p><i>EntamÅba phagocytoides</i> (Gauducheau, 1908). This parasite was
discovered in a case of dysentery at Hanoi, Indo-China. The amÅba
is small, 2&nbsp;Âµ to 15&nbsp;Âµ in diameter. It is active. It ingests bacteria and
red blood corpuscles, while peculiar spirilla-like bodies are found in
its cytoplasm. It multiplies by binary and multiple fission. It can
be cultivated. More recently (1912) the author appears to consider
the amÅba to be a stage of a <i>Trichomonas</i>, but abandons the view
later (1914). Further researches on this organism are needed.</p>

<p><i>EntamÅba minuta</i> (Elmassian, 1909)<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> was found, in association
with <i>E. coli</i>, in a case of chronic dysentery in Paraguay. It resembles
<i>E. tetragena</i> but is smaller, rarely exceeding 14&nbsp;Âµ in diameter. Schizogony
occurs, four merozoites being produced. The encystment is
total and endogenous, giving rise to cysts containing four nuclei.
This amÅba is considered by Darling and others to be the pre-cyst
trophozoite stage of <i>E. histolytica</i> (<i>tetragena</i>).</p>

<p><i>EntamÅba nipponica</i> (Koidzumi, 1909) was found in the motions
of Japanese suffering from dysentery or from diarrhÅa, in the former
case in company with <i>EntamÅba histolytica</i>. Its diameter is 15&nbsp;Âµ to
30&nbsp;Âµ. The endoplasm is phagocytic for red blood corpuscles. The
nucleus is well defined, resembling that of <i>E. coli</i> and of <i>E. tetragena</i>.
Multiplication occurs by binary fission and by schizogony. Encystment
is total, but has not been completely followed. Darling and
others consider that this is an abnormal form of <i>E. histolytica</i>,
while Akashi (1913) doubts if it is an amÅba at all, but rather is
to be regarded as shed epithelial cells.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Remark.</span>&mdash;It is now considered by some workers that
true EntamÅbÃ¦ cannot be cultivated on artificial media. Quite
recently Williams and Calkins (1913)<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> have somewhat doubted this
opinion, and state that certain cultural amÅbÃ¦, originally obtained
from Musgrave in Manila, exhibit the various morphological variations
associated with true entamÅbÃ¦ of the human digestive tract.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span></p>

<p class="spec"><b>EntamÅba buccalis</b>, Prowazek, 1904.</p>

<p>The size varies from 6&nbsp;Âµ to 32&nbsp;Âµ. Ectoplasm is always present;
the endoplasm contains numerous food-vacuoles. The nucleus is
vesicular, with a greenish tinted membrane which is poor in
chromatin. The size of the nucleus is from 1Â·5&nbsp;Âµ to 4Â·5&nbsp;Âµ. A contractile
vacuole is not visible. The pseudopodium is broad. It was
discovered in the mouths of persons with dental caries at Rovigno and
also at Trieste, being most easily found in dense masses of leucocytes,
also among leptothrix and spirochÃ¦te clusters. It can be easily distinguished
from leucocytes by more intense staining with neutral red.
Multiplication proceeds by fission. Transmission may take place
through the small spherical cysts. This species (fig.&nbsp;10) has since been
observed in Berlin, and is also occasionally found in carcinoma of
various regions of the oral cavity. (Leyden and LÃ¶wenthal, 1905).</p>

<p><i>EntamÅba buccalis</i>, Prow., is said to be allied to a protozoÃ¶n which
A. Tietze has found either encysted or free in the lumen of the orifice
of the parotid gland of an infant aged 4 months. The gland had
undergone pathological change, and had therefore been extirpated.
The organisms, which were roundish and three to four times the size
of the normal epithelial cells of the gland, were without a membrane
and possessed a nucleus in which the chromatic substance appeared
to be contained in a karyosome. Bass and Johnâs<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> (Feb. 1915) and
Smith, Middleton and Barrett (1914) state that <i>E. buccalis</i> is the cause
of pyorrhÅa alveolaris.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="spec"><i>EntamÅba undulans</i>, Aldo Castellani, 1905.</p>

<p>Under this name a protozoÃ¶n is described which A. Castellani found in addition
to <i>EntamÅba histolytica</i> and <i>Trichomonas intestinalis</i> in the fÃ¦ces of an European
planter living in Ceylon, who had suffered from amÅbic enteritis and liver abscess.
The shape of the body was roundish or oval, 25&nbsp;Âµ to 30&nbsp;Âµ in the greatest diameter.
It was without a flagellum, but with an undulating membrane, and capable of protruding
a long pseudopodium from different parts of its body at short intervals. The
nucleus could not always be recognized in life; it was, however, always demonstrable<span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
by staining. One or two contractile vacuoles were present. The protoplasm was
finely granular, showing no differentiation into ecto- and endo-plasm. According to
Braun, in spite of the author declaring himself expressly against the flagellate nature
of the parasite, such a nature may be assumed to be tolerably certain in view of the
description and illustration.</p>

<p>It is now considered that <i>EntamÅba undulans</i> is a portion of a flagellate,
namely, <i>Trichomonas</i>.</p></div>

<p>Doflein gave this name to amÅbÃ¦, from 30&nbsp;Âµ to 38&nbsp;Âµ in diameter,
which Kartulis (1893) found on examining the pus of an abscess in the
right lower jaw of an Arab, aged 43, and in a portion of bone that had been
extracted. The movements of the amÅbÃ¦
(fig.&nbsp;11) were more active than those of
âdysenteric amÅbÃ¦.â Their coarsely
granular cytoplasm contained blood and
pus corpuscles, and a nucleus was generally
only recognizable after staining. Vacuoles
were not seen with certainty. Flexner reported
upon a similar case, and Kartulis
published five additional cases. As in these
cases dental caries was present the infection
is likely to have proceeded from the oral
cavity as a result of the carious teeth.
Craig<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> (1911) considers that this parasite is
probably identical with <i>EntamÅba histolytica</i>.</p>

<p>In the literature the following species have been reported as
occurring in the oral cavity of <span class="nowrap">man:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="spec"><i>AmÅba gingivalis</i>, Gros, 1849. [? identical with <i>EntamÅba buccalis</i>.]<br />

<i>AmÅba dentalis</i>, Grassi, 1879.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Far too little, however, is known concerning these to regard them as definite
species, that is, independent organisms; Grassi thinks it even possible there may
have been a confusion in their case with salivary corpuscles. If they really are
amÅbÃ¦ they are all of them probably identical with <i>EntamÅba buccalis</i>.</p>


<p class="spec">Genus <b>ParamÅba</b>, Schaudinn, 1896.</p>

<p>Schaudinn established the genus <i>ParamÅba</i> for a marine rhizopod which multiplied
by division, became encysted at the end of its vegetative life and then
segmented into swarm bodies with two flagella. These multiplied by longitudinal
fission, and finally passed into the condition of AmÅbÃ¦. Whether the human parasite
described by C.&nbsp;F. Craig (1906) as</p><span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>

<p class="spec"><b>ParamÅba hominis.</b></p>

<p>belonged to this genus was for a time uncertain. It is now placed in a new genus
Craigia, Calkins, 1912, since it possesses only one flagellum.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>In the amÅbic stage it is 15&nbsp;Âµ to 25&nbsp;Âµ in diameter; ecto- and endo-plasm during
rest are indistinguishable. The body substance is granular, with a spherical, sharply
contoured nucleus and an accessory nuclear body. No vacuoles are present, but
occasionally the endoplasm contains red blood corpuscles. The pseudopodia are
hyaline, finger- or lobe-shaped, and are protruded either singly or in twos.
Multiplication is by binary fission and by the formation of spherical cysts (15&nbsp;Âµ to
20&nbsp;Âµ in diameter) in which occurs successive division of the nuclei, ultimately forming
ten to twelve roundish bodies each of which soon develops a flagellum. The flagellate
stages have similarly a spherical shape and attain a diameter of 10&nbsp;Âµ to 15&nbsp;Âµ.
They also occasionally contain red blood corpuscles and pass either directly or after
longitudinal division into the amÅboid phase.</p>

<p>Craig found these AmÅbÃ¦ and the flagellate stage belonging to them in six
patients in the military hospital at Manila (Philippine Islands), five of whom were
suffering from simple diarrhÅa whilst the sixth exhibited an amÅbic enteritis and
contained also <i>ParamÅba hominis</i>, with <i>EntamÅba histolytica</i>, Schaudinn. In one
of the other cases, <i>Trichomonas intestinalis</i> was present.</p></div>

<p>Artault<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> discovered a few amÅboid forms with nucleus and
vacuole in the contents of a lung cavity. In the fresh condition they
were distinguishable from leucocytes by their remarkable capacity of
light refraction. They were also much slower than the latter in
staining with methylene blue or fuchsine. Their movements became
more lively in a strong light. Water and other reagents killed them,
and then, even when stained, they could not be distinguished from
leucocytes. They have also been seen by Brumpt. R. Blanchard found
amÅbÃ¦ which may belong here in the lungs of sheep. <i>A. pulmonalis</i>
is perhaps the same as <i>EntamÅba buccalis</i>. Smith and Weidman<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>

lungs and other organs of infants in America.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>AmÅba urogenitalis</b>, Baelz, 1883.</p>

<p>This species was found in masses in the sanguineous urine as well
as in the vagina of a patient in Japan, aged 23. Shortly before the
death of the patient, which was caused by pulmonary tuberculosis,
hÃ¦maturia with severe tenesmus of the bladder had set in. The
amÅba, which showed great motility, and had a diameter of about
50&nbsp;Âµ when quiescent, exhibited a granular cytoplasm and a vesicular
nucleus. Baelz is of opinion that these parasites were introduced into
the vulva with the water used for washing the parts, and thence had<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
penetrated into the bladder and vagina. Doflein places the organism
in the genus <i>EntamÅba</i>, and it is perhaps identical with <i>E. histolytica</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Similar cases are also reported (1892â3) by other authors: JÃ¼rgens, Kartulis, Posner,
and Wijnhoff. JÃ¼rgens found small mucous cysts, filled with amÅboid bodies, in the
bladder of an old woman suffering from chronic cystitis; they were also found
in the vagina. The amÅba observed by Kartulis in the sanguineous urine of
a woman, aged 58, suffering from a tumour of the bladder, measured 12&nbsp;Âµ to 20&nbsp;Âµ,
and exhibited slow movements by protruding short pseudopodia. The vacuoles and
nucleus became visible only after staining with methylene blue.</p>

<p>Posnerâs case related to a man, aged 37, who had hitherto been quite healthy and
had never been out of Berlin. Suddenly, after a rigor, he passed urine tinged with
blood. This contained, besides red and white blood corpuscles and hyaline and
granular casts, large granular bodies (about 50&nbsp;Âµ in length and 28&nbsp;Âµ in breadth), which
slowly altered their shape, and contained red blood corpuscles in addition to other
foreign matter. These bodies exhibited one or several nuclei and some vacuoles.
From the course of the disease, which extended over a year, and during which
similar attacks recurred, Posner came to the conclusion that the amÅbÃ¦ which had
originally invaded the bladder had penetrated into the pelvis of the kidney, where
they probably had settled in a cyst, and thence induced the repeated attacks.</p>

<p>Wijnhoff observed four cases of amÅburia in Utrecht.</p>

patient. The bodies were usually spherical or
ellipsoidal, and at one pole carried a small protuberance
(fig.&nbsp;12) beset with filamentous short
âpseudopodiaâ (really a pseudopodium covered
with cilia). Their size varied between 15&nbsp;Âµ and
38&nbsp;Âµ. The cytoplasm was finely granular, and
no difference was observable in the ecto- and
endo-plasm, only the villous appendage
was clearer. The cytoplasm contained vacuoles
more or less numerous, none of which was
contractile. After the addition of acetic acid one
to three nuclei could be distinguished, 8&nbsp;Âµ to 15&nbsp;Âµ in size. Actual movements were
not observed. Taking everything into consideration, the independent nature of these
bodies is, to say the least, doubtful, although it cannot be denied that they possess a
certain similarity to the marine <i>AmÅba fluida</i>, GrÃ¼ber or Greeff, and to a few other
species. (It is likely that cells present in serous exudation were mistaken for amÅbÃ¦.)</p></div>

<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Chlamydophrys</b>, Cienkowski, 1876.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The genus is based on a form which A. Schneider carefully investigated and
considered to be the <i>Difflugia enchelys</i> of Ehrenberg. L. Cienkowski rediscovered
this same form and created for it the genus <i>Chlamydophrys</i>. We agree
with this view, but not with the renaming of the organism (so common at the time).
If the parasite in dung, <i>Chlamydophrys stercorea</i> Cienk. is identical with <i>Difflugia
enchelys</i> of Ehrenberg, the old specific name should be retained.</p></div>

<p>The genus is characterized by the possession of a hyaline, structureless,
slightly flexible shell which is ovoid or reniform. At the more
pointed pole there is an orifice situated terminally or somewhat laterally,
serving for the emergence of the filiform pseudopodia (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_13">13</a>, <i>a</i>).
The protoplasm does not entirely fill the interior of the shell. An
equatorial zone bearing excretory granules divides the shell internally
into two almost equal portions. The anterior portion is rich in
vacuoles and serves for the reception of nutriment and for digestion.
The posterior part is vitreous, and contains the nucleus. One to three
contractile vacuoles are situated in the equatorial zone.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Chlamydophrys enchelys</b>, Ehrbg.</p>

<p class="syn">Syn.: <i>Chlamydophrys stercorea</i>, L. Cienkowski.</p>

<p>This species (fig.&nbsp;13) is found in the fÃ¦ces of various animals (cattle,
rabbits, mice, and lizards), and also in quite fresh human fÃ¦ces.
According to Schaudinn, the parasite occurs so frequently in the
human fÃ¦ces that it must be considered of wide distribution. The
species must traverse the intestine of man and animals during one
stage of its life cycle, as Schaudinn showed by experiments on himself
and on mice. He infected himself with cysts (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_14">14</a>) by swallowing
them, and evacuated the first <i>Chlamydophrys</i> as early as the following
day. After the evacuation of numerous specimens on one of the
following days the infection ceased.</p>

<p>The nucleus of a living specimen is surrounded by a hyaline,
strongly refractile chromidial mass, arranged in the form of a ring.
Chromatin stains colour it darkly.</p>

<p><i>Asexual multiplication</i> (fig.&nbsp;13, <i>b</i>), which takes place in fÃ¦ces, follows<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
a similar course to that of allied forms (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Euglypha</i>, <i>Centropyxis</i>). It
commences by the cytoplasm issuing from the orifice of the shell and
assuming the shape characteristic of the mother organism, but in
a reverse position. The nucleus then divides by mitosis, when the
daughter nuclei move apart from one another. The chromidial ring
also divides into two portions by a process of dumb-bell like constriction.
The one daughter nucleus remains in the mother organism,
the other moves towards the daughter individual, which then separates
from the parent.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In this species plasmogamic union of two or more individuals (up to twenty) is
frequently observed. Such colonies may similarly divide, and in this way monstrosities
frequently arise. When drying of the fÃ¦ces, or deficiency of food occurs,
encystment takes place apparently spontaneously. The whole body, as stated by
Cienkowski, issues from the shell, assumes a spherical shape (probably with discharge
of water) and becomes surrounded with a thick membrane (fig.&nbsp;14). After the addition
of water and the escape of the encysted <i>Chlamydophrys</i>, a new shell must be formed.
Schaudinn, who has not given a more detailed description of the process of encystment
in this species, but refers to Cienkowski and to similar observations made on
<i>Centropyxis</i>, states of the latter that the encystment takes place within the shell.</p></div>

</div>

<p>The <i>sexual multiplication</i> is accompanied by shedding of all the
foreign bodies and of the degenerating nucleus. The protoplasm,
now contracting into a sphere, remains behind in the shell with the
chromidial mass. From the latter several new nuclei arise (sexual
nuclei) often eight in number. The cytoplasmic sphere then segregates
into as many spherical portions as there are nuclei present.
When they have assumed an oval form, two flagella develop at one<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>

swarm-spores, or gametes, copulate in pairs and apparently the individuals
of the pairs of gametes arise from different mother organisms.
The zygote secretes a thick covering which soon
becomes brown and rough. These zygote cysts
or resistant spores must now pass from the intestine
of an animal in order to complete their
development. The escape of the cyst contents
does not always take place in the intestine;
often it does not occur until after defÃ¦cation.
These shell-less individuals (amÅbulÃ¦) soon
become invested with a shell. But in the
alkaline intestinal contents, shell formation may
proceed even while the organism is in the intestine,
and multiplication may take place.</p>

<p class="spec"><b>Leydenia gemmipara</b>, Schaudinn, 1896.</p>

<p>In the fluid removed by puncture from two patients suffering
from ascites in the first medical clinic in Berlin, cellular bodies
with spontaneous movement were found, which Leyden and
Schaudinn regard as distinct organisms. They remained alive
without the use of the warm stage for four or five hours, the
external temperature being 24Â° to 25Â°&nbsp;C. In a quiescent condition
they were of a spherical or irregular polygonal form. Their surface was
rarely smooth, being beset with protuberances and excrescences (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_15">15</a>).
The substance of the body was thickly permeated with light refractile
granules with a yellowish shimmer. The hyaline ectoplasm was
rarely seen distinctly. All sizes from 3&nbsp;Âµ to 36&nbsp;Âµ in diameter were
observed. The movements were rather sluggish, the ectoplasm in
the meantime appearing in the form of one or several lamellÃ¦, in
which also strings of the granular endoplasm occurred, and frequently
protruded over the border of the hyaline pseudopodia. The tendency
for the joining of several individuals by means of their pseudopodia
was so marked that associations ensued similar to those known in
free-living Rhizopoda.</p>

<p>The cytoplasm enclosed blood corpuscles as well as numerous
vacuoles, one of which pulsated slowly about every quarter of an
hour. A vesicular nucleus the diameter of which was about equal
to one-fifth of the body was present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span></p>

<p>Multiplication took place by means of division and budding (fig.&nbsp;15, <i>c</i>),
after previous direct division of the nucleus. The buds were supposed
to divide repeatedly soon after their appearance, thus giving rise to
minute forms of 3&nbsp;Âµ.</p>

<p>There was a suspicion in both cases that the ascites was associated
with malignant neoplasms in the abdomen, and autopsy confirmed
this view in one case.</p>

<p>The parasite, which has seldom been observed, has been variously
interpreted; for example, it has been regarded merely as altered tissue
cells. It is now known, from Schaudinnâs researches, that <i>Leydenia
gemmipara</i> is connected with abnormal conditions of <i>Chlamydophrys</i>,
occasionally occurring as a commensal in the ascitic fluid. The form
is produced when pathological conditions of the large intestine create
an alkaline reaction of its whole contents. The formation of shells
then often ceases, and these naked <i>Chlamydophrys</i> are enabled to
multiply atypically by division and gemmation. Such stages, which
are no longer capable of a normal development, are the <i>Leydenia</i>, as
Schaudinn has demonstrated.</p>


<h4>Class II. <b>MASTIGOPHORA</b>, Diesing.</h4>

<p class="spec">Sub-Class. FLAGELLATA, Cohn emend. BÃ¼tschli.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During the motile part of their life the Flagellata possess one or more flagella
which serve for locomotion, and in many cases also for the capture of food. A few
groups (<i>EuglenoidinÃ¦</i>, <i>Choanoflagellata</i>) have only one flagellum, others two or
several of about equal length (<i>Isomastigoda</i>), or of various lengths (<i>Monadina</i>,
<i>Heteromastigoda</i>, <i>Dinoflagellata</i>). The long flagellum is the principal one; the
smaller ones on the same organism are accessory flagella. The flagella directed<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
backwards, which occur in the Heteromastigoda and are used for clinging, are
termed trailing flagella or tractella. At the base of the flagellum, which is almost
always at the anterior end, a Choanoflagellate possesses a cytoplasmic funnel-shaped
neck or collar. In the parasitic forms an undulating membrane is often present.</p>

<p>The body of the Flagellata is usually small, generally elongate and of unchangeable
form. It is frequently covered by a distinct cuticle, and, in certain groups,
by a hard envelope, or it may be more or less loosely enveloped by a gelatinous or
membranous covering. An ectoplasmic layer is thin and not always obvious. The
granular cytoplasm contains a varying number of vacuoles, one of which may be
contractile, and is generally situated near the area from which the flagella arise,
that is, at the anterior extremity. The cytoplasm, moreover, contains the nucleus,
which is nearly always single; and in many species there are also yellow, brown,
or green chromatophores of various shapes, such as occur in plants. Some
species feed after the manner of green plants (holophytic), or of plants devoid of
chlorophyll (saprophytic); others, again, ingest solid food, and for this purpose
usually possess a cytostome; the latter, however, in a few forms is not used for its
original function, but is connected with the contractile vacuole. Many parasitic
forms feed by endosmosis. A few species possess eye-spots with or without light-refracting
bodies.</p>

<p>Variation in the form of the nuclear apparatus occurs. One nucleus only, which
may be compact or vesicular, is known in many species. This nucleus is situated
either centrally or sometimes near the flagellar end of the body, but its position is
subject to variation. The flagella may arise near the nucleus. Other structures,
such as an axial filament and a rhizoplast, may be present. Some flagellates are
binucleate, the two nuclei&mdash;which often differ in size and shape&mdash;being separated
from each other. One of these nuclei is the principal, vegetative or trophic nucleus;
the other is an accessory nucleus, frequently termed the blepharoplast, flagellar
or kinetic nucleus. One or more small basal granules are often present at or very
near the origin of the flagella.</p>

<p>Multiplication is by fission, usually longitudinal, which may occur in either the
free or encysted forms. Division is initiated by that of the nucleus or nuclei
(especially the kinetic nucleus). The basal granule divides also. Collars and
chromatophores, if present, likewise separate into two. Variation in the method of
doubling the original number of flagella occurs. In most organisms, especially
uniflagellate forms, the flagellum splits lengthwise, after division of the basal granule,
blepharoplast and nucleus. The daughter flagella may be of the same or different
lengths and thicknesses. Other flagellates at division are said to produce new
flagella in the neighbourhood of the original ones. The daughter organisms in such
cases are provided with one or more parental flagella in addition to newly formed
ones. It has been stated that in certain cases the parent flagellate retains all its
flagella, while new ones arise <i>ab initio</i> in the cytoplasm of the daughter forms.</p>

<p>Multiplication by longitudinal fission may be interrupted sooner or later by the
production of gametes, which form zygotes, from which new generations of individuals
arise. In many flagellates gamete formation and sporogony are unknown,
and asexual reproduction by fission alone prevails.</p>

<p>Incomplete division results in the formation of colonies of individuals. These
colonies must not be confused with the aggregation rosettes of flagellates found
among the parasitic Mastigophora. The individuals of aggregation rosettes are
capable of immediate separation from the rosette at will.</p>

<p>A number of parasitic Flagellata produce non-flagellate stages which are very
resistant to external conditions, the assumption of which forms serves to protect the
organisms during their transference from one host to another. Such non-flagellate
forms possess one or more nuclei, are usually of an oval or rounded contour, and<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
are capable of developing into the full flagellate on the return of more favourable
conditions. These forms are often known as the post-flagellate stage of the
organism. When ingested by a new host, the post-flagellate coat becomes more
flexible, and the phase of the organism which now recommences growth is known as
the pre-flagellate stage; it gradually develops into the typical flagellate organism.</p>

<p>Many Flagellata live free in fresh and salt water. They prefer stagnant water,
rich in organic products of decomposition, such as puddles, swamps and pools.
Those forms developing shells and colonies are, as a rule, adherent. A number of
species are parasitic in man and animals, living mostly within the intestine or in the
blood.</p>

<p>It is usual to classify the Flagellata in four orders: <i>Euflagellata</i>, <i>Dinoflagellata</i>,
<i>Choanoflagellata</i>, and <i>Cystoflagellata</i>, of which only the <i>Euflagellata</i> are of interest
to us. This is a group comprising numerous species, for the further classification
of which the number and position of the flagella are utilised.</p>

<p>The Euflagellata observed in man belong to the Protomonadina as well as to the
Polymastigina. The former possess either only one or two similar flagella, or one
principal and one or two accessory flagella. The Polymastigina possess at least
three flagella of equal size, or four to eight of unequal size, inserted at different
points. An undulating membrane may be present in members of both groups.</p>

<p>It must also be pointed out that unicellular organisms with one or several
flagella are not always classified with flagellates, for such forms occur in Rhizopods
as well as temporarily in the lower plants. In addition, the examination of the
flagellates, especially the parasitic species, is very difficult on account of their
diminutive size and great activity; thus it happens that certain forms cannot with
certainty be included in the group because their description is insufficient.</p></div>


<p class="spec">Order. <b>Polymastigina</b>, Blochmann.</p>

<p>The Polymastigina contains flagellates with three to eight flagella.
Some of the Flagellata parasitic in man belong to the Polymastigina,
and to two or three genera that are easily distinguishable.</p>


<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Trichomonas</b>, DonnÃ©, 1837.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The body is generally pyriform, the anterior part usually rounded, the posterior
part pointed. There are at the anterior extremity three (? four) equally long flagella
that are sometimes matted together. A blepharoplast (kinetic nucleus) and basal
granule are present, together with a supporting structure known as an axial
filament or axostyle. In addition there is an undulating membrane, bordered by a
trailing flagellum, that commences at the anterior extremity and proceeds obliquely
backwards. The nucleus, which is vesicular, is situated near the anterior extremity,
and behind it are one or more vacuoles, none of which seems to be contractile.
These flagellates are parasitic in vertebrate animals, and live chiefly in the intestine.</p></div>


<p class="spec"><b>Trichomonas vaginalis</b>, DonnÃ©.</p>

<p>The form of the body is very variable, and is elongate, fusiform
or pear-shaped, also amÅboid. The length varies between 15&nbsp;Âµ and
25&nbsp;Âµ, and the breadth between 7&nbsp;Âµ and 12&nbsp;Âµ. The posterior extremity
is drawn out to a point and is about half the length of the remainder<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
of the body. The cuticle is very thin and the body substance finely
granular. At the anterior extremity there are three&mdash;some say four<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>&mdash;flagella
of equal length which are frequently united together, at least
at the base, and are easily detached.</p>

<p>There is an undulating membrane (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_16">16</a>)
which runs spirally across the body, arising
from the place of insertion of the flagella, and
terminating at the base of the caudal process.
A cytostome seldom is recognizable in fresh
specimens, but is apparently present. The
nucleus is vesicular, elliptical and situated near
the anterior extremity.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Multiplication takes place by division
(Marchand). Encysted forms are almost unknown.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i> lives in the vaginal mucus of
women of various ages, not in normal mucus, but in
mucus of acid reaction. It is found in menstruating
females as well as in females who have passed the
menopause. It occurs in pregnant and non-pregnant
women, even in very young girls, provided always that
they have a vaginal catarrh with acid reaction of the
secretion. Should the acid reaction change, as, for
instance, during menstruation, the parasites disappear,
as they do likewise on injection of any alkaline fluid into
the vagina. A low temperature (below +15Â°&nbsp;C.) is also
fatal to the parasites. These flagellates can pass from
the vagina through the urethra into the bladder, and
produce severe catarrh, and are not easily removed.</p></div>

<p>Some authors believe that a second trichomonad inhabiting man,
<i>Trichomonas intestinalis</i>, R. Lkt., is identical with <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i>,
DonnÃ©. Leuckartâs species was based on the discoveries of Marchand
(1875) and Zunker (1878), who stated that according to all appearances,
and in their opinion, it was the same as <i>Cercomonas intestinalis</i>, Lambl,
1875 (<i>nec</i> 1859), which they found in
the fÃ¦ces of patients suffering from
intestinal disorders. The organism
is described by them as being pear-shaped
and 10&nbsp;Âµ to 15&nbsp;Âµ in length
and 3&nbsp;Âµ to 4&nbsp;Âµ in breadth. The

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A row of twelve or more cilia was said to
commence at the anterior end and extend
over the body. Leuckart stated that this
parasite, placed by the two authors in the
genus <i>Cercomonas</i>, was a <i>Trichomonas</i>, and
that they mistook the undulating membrane for cilia, and overlooked the flagella.
Notwithstanding its striking similarity with <i>T. vaginalis</i>, it was said to be distinguishable
from that species by differences in the undulating membrane. Lamblâs
<i>C. intestinalis</i><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> (of 1875) which corresponds with <i>C. hominis</i>, Davaine<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> (1854), is
regarded by Leuckart as a true Cercomonad (characterized by a flagellum and the
absence of an undulating membrane, see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_61">61</a>), and is thus generically distinct
from <i>Trichomonas</i>.</p>

<p>The correctness of Leuckartâs judgment in regard to Marchand-Zunkerâs flagellate
was demonstrated by Grassiâs researches, accounts of which were published soon
after. In about 100 cases of bowel complaints in North Italy and Sicily, Grassi
found Flagellata in the stools, which he first named <i>Monocercomonas</i> and <i>CimÃ¦nomonas</i>,
but later termed <i>Trichomonas</i>. However, in opposition to Leuckart, Grassi
has also classified Davaineâs <i>C. hominis</i> (= <i>C. intestinalis</i>, Lambl, 1875) as
<i>Trichomonas</i>, and most authors have followed his example. Hence arose the use
of the name <i>Trichomonas hominis</i>. It was through Janowski (1896) that the
former view was again taken up. After a review of the literature, the occurrence
of Cercomonads in the intestine of human beings in addition to Trichomonads
was considered by the author to have been proved, and he added a
description of the Trichomonads. According to this, all morphological distinction<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
between <i>T. vaginalis</i>, DonnÃ©, and <i>T. intestinalis</i>, Leuckart, disappeared. On the
other hand, it is worthy of note that the smaller size, the more pear-shaped form, and
the longer flagella differentiate <i>T. intestinalis</i> (= <i>T. hominis</i>) from <i>T. vaginalis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p></div>

begin near the nucleus and blepharoplast, which are
situated near the more rounded, anterior end of the
body. There may be a chromatoid basal supporting
line along the body for the undulating membrane.
Rows of chromatoid granules are sometimes situated
along one side of the axostyle. A cytostome may
sometimes be seen. In mice, Wenyon (1907) found
these parasites to vary in length from 3&nbsp;Âµ to 20&nbsp;Âµ.
They occur in the cÃ¦cum and intestine of mice,
where their internal structure seems more obvious
than in man. The flagellates divide by longitudinal
fission.</p>

<p><i>T. intestinalis</i>, R. Leuckart, appears to be capable
of settling in all parts of the human intestine in which
the contents have an alkaline reaction. Trichomonads
have been cited as occurring in the oral cavity by
Steinberg, Zunker, Rappin and Prowazek; in the
Åsophagus by Cohnheim, and in the stomach by
Strube, Cohnheim, Zabel, Hensen and Rosenfeld.
The normal situation seems to be the small intestine.
The parasites then appear in the dejecta, especially in various intestinal
diseases the course of which is connected with an increased peristalsis.
They are also found in healthy persons, from whom they are obtained
after the administration of laxatives. They have been regarded by some
workers as commensals, which, however, have the power of accelerating<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
the onset of intestinal complaints, or at least of adding to them. They
have been found in cases of carcinoma of the stomach, and in other
diseases of that organ in which the acid reaction ceased.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Naturally, whether all the reports relate to the same species of Trichomonas
must remain undecided. Certain authors (Steinberg, Cohnheim, van Emden)
accept several species. Prowazek speaks of a variety of <i>T. intestinalis</i> inhabiting
the oral cavity. This was distinguished by a posterior process exceeding the
length of the body fourfold, and by a somewhat unusual course of the undulating
membrane. The food of this form, which was found in the whitish deposit present,
especially in the cavities of carious teeth, consisted almost exclusively of micrococci.
Schmidt and St. Artault named the Trichomonads found in pathological products
(<i>e.g.</i>, gangrene, putrid bronchitis, phthisis) of the lungs of man, as <i>Trichomonas
pulmonalis</i>. Trichomonads have also been found by Wieting in lobular pneumonia
in the lungs of pigs.</p>

<p>It is still uncertain in what way the infection takes place. Experiments in the
transmission of free trichomonads to mammals (<i>per os</i>), in which the same or allied
species occur (guinea-pigs, rats, apes), have been without result. Probably encystment
is necessary. Such conditions are mentioned by May, KÃ¼nstler, Roos,
Schurmayer, van Emden, Prowazek, Galli-Valerio and Schaudinn. According to
Prowazek, intestinal trichomonads of rats become encysted for conjugation. In the
cyst an accumulation of reserve food material occurs, causing distension. The nuclei
of the conjugants each give off a reduction body and, after fusion, produce the
nuclei for the daughter individuals. According to Schaudinn the intestinal trichomonads
lose their flagella before conjugation, become amÅboid and encyst in twos,
the formation of a large agglomeration of reserve substance accompanying this.
Galli-Valerio found double-contoured cysts in the fÃ¦ces of trichomonad-infected
guinea-pigs, after the fÃ¦ces had been kept for a month in a damp chamber. When
exposed to heat small flagellates escaped from them. Administration of such material
containing cysts resulted in severe infection with trichomonads, and death of the
experimental guinea-pigs followed. The cyst wall is clearly a protection against the
deleterious acid reaction of the stomach contents. Alexeieff (1911) and Brumpt (1912)
think that the trichomonad cysts of man are really fungi, while other workers also
doubt encystment among trichomonads. Wenyon (1907) states that <i>T. intestinalis</i> in
mice produces spherical contracted forms which escape from the body in the fÃ¦ces.</p>

<p>Air, water, and under certain circumstances even food may be regarded as
vectors for the trichomonads. The occurrence of the organisms in the oral cavity,
and still more so in the lungs, is in favour of the air being the transmitting agent.
An observation made by Epstein supports the idea of water transmission. Multiplication
of the trichomonads, once they have gained access to the body, is effected by
longitudinal division commencing at the anterior end (KÃ¼nstler). âCercomonadsâ
with several flagella and an undulating membrane, as well as trichomonads, have
been observed by Ross in some cases of cutaneous ulcers.</p></div>

<p>Mello-Leitao (1913)<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> has described flagellate dysentery in children
in Rio de Janeiro. He states that it is due to <i>T. intestinalis</i>
and <i>Lamblia intestinalis</i> either separately or together. Flagellate
dysentery, he thinks, is benign and is the most frequent form of
dysentery in infants. The flagellates are pathogenic to infants under
three years of age. Escomel (1913)<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> found 152 cases of dysentery in

<p>The genus <i>Tetramitus</i> differs from <i>Trichomonas</i> in possessing an

are three anterior flagella. The pear-shaped organism measures 14&nbsp;Âµ

the Bahamas in the Seamenâs Hospital, London. Its occurrence
is widespread. Alexeieff considers that <i>Macrostoma</i> and <i>Tetramitus</i>
are synonymous. The parasite is the same as <i>Fanapapea intestinalis</i>,
Prowazek, 1911, from Samoa. Brumpt (1912) found <i>T. mesnili</i> to be
the causal agent of colitis in a Frenchwoman. Nattan-Larrier (1912)
considers it of little pathological importance.</p>

<p>GÃ¤bel<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> (1914) described an interesting case of seasonal diarrhÅa

The organism was pear-shaped, without an undulating membrane,
and measured 6Â·5&nbsp;Âµ to 8&nbsp;Âµ by 5&nbsp;Âµ to 6&nbsp;Âµ. The cytostome was large,
and there was no skeletal support. Encystment occurred. GÃ¤bel

1881; <i>Megastoma intestinale</i>, R. Blanch., 1886; <i>Lamblia duodenalis</i>, Stiles, 1902.</p>

<p>The organism is pear-shaped and bilaterally symmetrical. It is
from 10&nbsp;Âµ to 21&nbsp;Âµ long and 5&nbsp;Âµ to 12&nbsp;Âµ broad and possesses a thin
cuticle. Anteriorly an oblique depression is present, which functions
as a sucking disc (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_19">19</a>, <i>s</i>). Its edges are raised above the general
surface and are contractile. It corresponds to a peristome and acts as
an adhesive organ (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_20">20</a>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>). No true cytostome is present. A
double longitudinal ridge, representing axostyles, extends from the
sucking disc to the tapering posterior extremity, which is prolonged
as two flagella from 9&nbsp;Âµ to 14&nbsp;Âµ long.</p>

<p><i>Lamblia intestinalis</i> possesses eight flagella (fig.&nbsp;19). The first pair<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
of flagella, which cross one another, arise in a groove formed by the
anterior edge of the sucking disc. Two pairs of flagella (lateral and
median) are inserted on the posterior edge of the disc, while the
posterior flagella occur at the tapering posterior extremity of the body.
Basal granules are found at the bases of the flagella. The median
flagella are most active in movement, the anterior and lateral flagella
being less motile, as they are partially united to the body for part of
their length.</p>

<p>The nuclear apparatus is situated in the thin, anterior, hollowed
part of the body. It is at first dumb-bell shaped, the âhandleâ of the
dumb-bell being formed by a very slight connecting strand, which
eventually separates, so that the flagellate becomes binucleate, and thus
completes the general bisymmetry of the organism.</p>

<p>There is a karyosome in each nucleus. Other bodies of unknown
function, and possibly composed of chromatin, occur on or near
the axostyles.</p>

<p>Division has not been observed in the flagellate stages of the
Lamblia, but it occurs within the cysts. The resistant cysts (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_20">20</a>, <i>e</i>)
are oval and are surrounded by a fairly thick, hyaline cyst wall.
They measure 10&nbsp;Âµ to 15&nbsp;Âµ by 7&nbsp;Âµ to 9&nbsp;Âµ, and may be tetranucleate.
According to Schaudinn, the cysts arise from the conjugation of two
individuals, and nuclear rearrangement occurs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span></p>

<p><i>L. intestinalis</i> occurs in its flagellate stage in the duodenum and
jejunum, and rarely as such in the other parts of the intestine.
Normally it is found in the large intestine as cysts, which are voided
with the fÃ¦ces. The hosts of Lamblia include <i>Mus musculus</i>, <i>M.
rattus</i>, <i>M. decumanus</i>, <i>M. silvestris</i>, <i>Arvicola arvensis</i> and <i>A. amphibius</i>,
the dog and cat, rabbit, sheep and man. Cysts voided with the fÃ¦ces
of infected animals reach plants or drinking water, and thence are
transferred to man.</p>

<p>The flagellate in these different hosts exhibits some variation in
size and in the problematic chromatic bodies. Bensen has suggested
the species <i>L. intestinalis</i> from man, <i>L. muris</i> from the mouse and
<i>L. cuniculi</i> from the rabbit. It is not certain whether these different
species are necessary, as the variation may be due to differences of
environment.</p>

</div>

<p>Like Trichomonas, Lamblia can multiply under inflammatory
conditions of the alimentary tract. Thus they are found in cases
of diarrhÅa, carcinoma of the stomach, etc. The parasites attach
themselves by their sucking discs to the epithelial cells of the gut
(fig.&nbsp;20, <i>c</i>), and though their numbers may be very great, their direct
pathological significance is not fully known. Their occurrence in
cases of diarrhÅa has been explained as being due to the increased
peristalsis, which has detached the parasites from the epithelium.
Free flagellate forms perish in stools if kept, more especially if the
temperature falls below 0Â°&nbsp;C. or rises above 40Â°&nbsp;C. Lamblia has
often been found in dysenteric diseases, especially in the East, and
is said to be the causal agent of certain diarrhÅas in India. Mathis
(1914)<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> found Lamblia in cases of diarrhÅa with dysenteriform stools
in Tonkin. He also discovered healthy carriers of Lamblia cysts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The parasite under discussion was first observed by Lambl (1859) in the mucous
evacuations of children. He regarded the parasite as a Cercomonad and termed
it <i>Cercomonas intestinalis</i>, which name as a rule is applied to <i>Cercomonas hominis</i>,
Davaine, although Stein had already pointed out the difference between the two species.
Grassi (1879) observed this species first in mice (calling it <i>Dimorphus muris</i>), and
subsequently in human beings in Upper Italy and named it <i>Megastoma entericum</i>.
BÃ¼tschli and Blanchard then laid stress on the identity of this species with Lamblâs
<i>C. intestinalis</i> (1859), and consequently called it <i>Megastoma intestinale</i>. Later,
Blanchard drew attention to the circumstance that the generic name <i>Megastoma</i>
chosen by Grassi had already been used four times for various kinds of animals,
and established the genus <i>Lamblia</i>. Accordingly, <i>L. intestinalis</i> is the valid name,
and should be generally adopted.</p>

<p>In Upper Italy the parasite in the encysted condition has also been seen by
Perroncito in man. At the same time, Grassi and Schewiakoff began a new
investigation of specimens from mice and rats. In Germany, <i>L. intestinalis</i>
was found by Moritz and HÃ¶lzl, Roos, Schuberg and Salomon. Moritz and HÃ¶lzl
confirmed the relative frequency of the species. In KÃ¶nigsberg, Prussia, a student
found encysted <i>Lamblia</i> in his fÃ¦ces. One case was reported from Finland by
Sievers, another case from Scandinavia by MÃ¼ller. Frshezjesski and Ucke reported
cases from Russia. Jaksch announced the occurrence of the parasite in Austria;
Piccardi mentioned their presence again in Italy. They were reported from Egypt
by Kruse and Pasquale, and from North America (Baltimore) by Stiles. Noc stated
that 50 per cent. of the population of Tonkin harboured <i>Lamblia</i>. Finally, the
structure of <i>L. intestinalis</i> has been described by Metzner (1901), and by Wenyon<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
(1907) in mice.</p></div>

<p>In all these cases <i>L. intestinalis</i> has been observed in the small
intestine, or in the evacuations of patients with intestinal diseases.
It has also been found in the intestine of healthy subjects. Just as
<i>Trichomonas intestinalis</i> may be found inhabiting the stomach in
diseases of that organ, in which an alkaline reaction is present
(carcinoma), so has <i>L. intestinalis</i> been found to occur under
similar circumstances (Cohnheim, Zabel). However, in Schmidtâs
case, 1 per cent. hydrochloric acid was certainly stated to be present.
Infection takes place by the ingestion of cysts (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_20">20</a>, <i>e</i>), as was
established by Grassi, experimentally on himself. Cereal food-stuffs,
contaminated with Lamblia cysts from vermin of the locality, such as
rats and mice, serve to convey the infection to man. Such cysts may
probably be found in street-dust, etc. Stiles induced infection in
guinea-pigs, and Perroncito in mice and rabbits, by means of cysts
of Lamblia from human beings. Stiles suspected that flies could
transport Lamblia cysts. Mathis (1914) found that <i>L. intestinalis</i>
was not amenable to emetine, at any rate in its cystic stage.</p>

<p>Davaine found flagellates in the dejecta of cholera patients. They
had pear-shaped bodies, lengthening to a point posteriorly. Their
length was from 10&nbsp;Âµ to 12&nbsp;Âµ, and a flagellum about twice as long as
the body projected from one extremity (fig.&nbsp;21). A nucleus was
hardly recognizable. Occasionally a somewhat long structure (cytostome?)
appeared at the anterior extremity. The animals moved with
remarkable activity. They also attached themselves by means of their
posterior extremities and swung about around the point of attachment.
Davaine found a smaller variety, only about 8&nbsp;Âµ long, in the dejecta
of a typhoid patient (fig.&nbsp;21, <i>b</i>).</p>

<p>The Flagellata observed by Ekeckrantz (1869) in the intestine of man belong to
this form&mdash;at least to the larger variety&mdash;and Tham (1870) reported fresh cases soon
after. Lamblâs publication of 1875, which was written in Russian, and became known
through Leuckartâs work on parasites, also alludes to apparently typical Cercomonads,
which, however, were discovered, not in the intestine, but in an <i>Echinococcus</i> cyst in
the liver (fig.&nbsp;22). The elliptical, fusiform, rarely pear-shaped or cylindrical bodies
of the parasites measured 5&nbsp;Âµ to 14&nbsp;Âµ in length, and were provided with a flagellum
at one end, while the other extremity usually terminated in a long point. An oral
aperture occurred at the base of the flagellum, and there were one or two vacuoles
near the posterior extremity. Longitudinal division was also observed (fig.&nbsp;22).</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span></p>

<p>As already mentioned, this form, which Lambl termed <i>Cercomonas
intestinalis</i>, differs considerably from the form found by the same
author in 1859, which received the same designation (<i>cf. Lamblia intestinalis</i>,
p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_60">60</a>), but it corresponds with <i>Cercomonas hominis</i>, Davaine.
The latter, as well as <i>C. intestinalis</i>, Lambl, 1875, is usually classed
with the Trichomonads, but, as has already been remarked (<i>cf.</i>
<i>Trichomonas intestinalis</i>, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_54">54</a>), this cannot be considered correct, as
only <i>one</i> flagellum is present.</p>

<p><i>Cercomonas vaginalis</i> (Castellani and Chalmers, 1909) was found
in the vagina of native women in Ceylon.</p>

<p>Other species of <i>Cercomonas</i> have, at various times, been recorded
from man. However, the parasitic species of the genus <i>Cercomonas</i>
require further investigation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>According to Janowski (1896â7), typical Cercomonads have also been observed in
the intestine of man by Escherich, also by Cahen, Massiutin, Fenoglio, Councilman and
Lafleur, Dock, Kruse and Pasquale, Zunker, Quincke and Roos, and others. However,
it is an open question whether the Flagellata observed by Roos in one of his cases
belonged to Davaineâs species, the size showing some deviation (14&nbsp;Âµ to 16&nbsp;Âµ). In
his, as in many other cases, doubts have been raised as to whether the flagellates
found in the stools had actually lived in the intestine, or had subsequently appeared
in the fÃ¦ces: for this a surprisingly short time only is necessary. Salomon also
appears to have observed Cercomonads (<i>Berl. klin. Wochenschr.</i>, 1899, No. 46).</p>

<p>As with <i>T. intestinalis</i> so with <i>C. hominis</i>, it appears
that the parasite settles not only in the intestine but also in
the air-passages. This is demonstrated by the statements of
Kannenberg and Streng of the occurrence of Monads and
Cercomonads in the sputum and putrid expectoration in
gangrene of the lungs, which no doubt apply to <i>C. hominis</i>
(<i>cf.</i> also Artault). Possibly also the Flagellata observed in the
pleural exudation by Litten and Roos may be included here;
this is the more probable in Roosâs case as the process ensued
in the pleura after the breaking through of a vomica.</p>

<p>Perroncito and Piccardi have described encysted stages of
Cercomonads.</p></div>

<p>R. Blanchard thus designates a Flagellate that Grimm
found in the sputum, as well as in the pus of a pulmonary and
hepatic abscess, in the case of a Japanese woman living in
Sapporo. The parasites resemble large spermatozoa (fig.&nbsp;23).
The body, 30&nbsp;Âµ to 60&nbsp;Âµ, has the shape of a heart or a myrtle leaf, and is surrounded by a
thick cuticle which is supposed to extend into the interior of the body, dividing it into
three parts. A long appendix at the rounded pole is covered for the greater part of
its length by the cuticle; the extremity, however, is free and resembles a flagellum.
The parasites were very active, frequently changed their shape, and were able to
retract the long appendix within the body, which then assumed a round form.</p>

<i>Cystomonas urinaria</i>, Blanchard, 1885; <i>Plagiomonas urinaria</i>, Braun, 1895.</p>

<p>Hassall<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> in 1859 first found Bodo-like flagellates in human urine.
He examined fifty samples of urine from patients suffering from
albuminuria and from cholera. The reaction of the urine was alkaline
or sometimes only feebly acid. The flagellates were only seen after
the urine had been standing for several days. Hassall named the
organism <i>Bodo urinarius</i>, and gave a very good description of it with
illustrations. The flagellate, which was round or oval, measured 14&nbsp;Âµ
by 8&nbsp;Âµ. The organism had <span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>âone, usually two, and sometimes three
lashes or cilia.â In 1868 Salisbury described a similar flagellate in
the urine under the name <i>Trichomonas irregularis</i>. KÃ¼nstler in 1883
described the latter parasite under the name <i>B. urinarius</i>. In 1885
Blanchard, considering KÃ¼nstlerâs organism a different parasite from
Hassallâs, called it <i>Cystomonas urinaria</i>. Braun, in 1895, gave the
name <i>Plagiomonas urinaria</i>. Barrois (1894) considered KÃ¼nstlerâs
and Hassallâs organisms to be identical and not to be true parasites
of man. Sinton,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> in 1912, found the flagellate in the deposit, after
centrifuging, of a 24-hour old specimen of alkaline urine from a
Mexican sailor in the Royal Southern Hospital, Liverpool. Sinton
found a kinetic nucleus or blepharoplast in the organism, and
therefore placed it in the genus <i>Prowazekia</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The flagellate stage (fig.&nbsp;24) of the organism is polymorphic, and may
be either (<i>a</i>) sausage-shaped, 10&nbsp;Âµ to 25&nbsp;Âµ in length by 2Â·5&nbsp;Âµ to 6&nbsp;Âµ in
breadth; (<i>b</i>) round or oval, varying from 4&nbsp;Âµ in diameter to oval
forms 15&nbsp;Âµ by 10&nbsp;Âµ; (<i>c</i>) a carrot-shaped form, of varying size up to
25&nbsp;Âµ by 4&nbsp;Âµ. The kinetic nucleus is large and pear-shaped. Near it
are basal granules, closely applied to one another, from which the
flagella arise. There is a small cytostome near the roots of the
flagella. There is a well-marked karyosome in the nucleus. The
movement is jerky. The shorter, anterior flagellum may be used in
food-capture. In life, bacteria have been seen to be ingested. Food-vacuoles
tend to accumulate at the posterior (aflagellar) end. A
contractile vacuole may be present, near the base of the cytostome,
and may really be the dilated fundus of the latter. Division occurs by<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
binary fission. The organism can encyst (fig.&nbsp;25, <i>a</i>), when the flagella are
lost, and round or oval cysts are found, 5&nbsp;Âµ to 7&nbsp;Âµ in diameter. After
a time flagella are formed inside the cyst, and the organism emerges
therefrom in its typical flagellate form (fig.&nbsp;25, <i>b</i>-<i>f</i>).</p>

<p>Sintonâs case is interesting. He obtained the flagellate only twice
from the same patient, a Mexican then in hospital in Liverpool. The
flagellate was not found in the patientâs fÃ¦ces, nor was it found in
the urine on later occasions when taken aseptically.</p>

<p>In cultures <i>Prowazekia urinaria</i> was always found in association
with bacteria. The cultures died at a temperature of 37Â°&nbsp;C., but grew
well at 20Â°&nbsp;C. Various media were useful at the lower temperature,
such as urine, salt agar, nutrient agar, serum agar, blood agar, peptone
salt solution, and diluted blood serum. The flagellate was, then,
considered to be an accidental contamination and not a true parasite
of human urine.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Prowazekia asiatica</b>, Castellani and Chalmers, 1910.</p>

<p>The flagellate was found by the discoverers in the stools of patients
suffering from ankylostomiasis and diarrhÅa in Ceylon. It was referred
by them to the genus <i>Bodo</i>, but in 1911 Whitmore<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> further studied
it and placed it in the genus <i>Prowazekia</i>. In the stools the flagellate
is found either as a long, slender form measuring 10&nbsp;Âµ to 16&nbsp;Âµ by 5&nbsp;Âµ
to 8&nbsp;Âµ or as a rounded form 8&nbsp;Âµ to 10&nbsp;Âµ in diameter. Its cytoplasm is
alveolar. A rhizoplast connects the basal granules to the kinetic<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
nucleus. There is multiplication and cyst formation as before. The
organism is easily cultivated, especially in the condensation water of
nutrose agar and maltose agar. The pathogenicity is stated to be nil.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Prowazekia javanensis</b>, Flu, 1912.</p>

<p>Found in agar cultures from the motions of patients at Weltevreden,
Dutch East Indies.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The flagellates are 12&nbsp;Âµ long and 5&nbsp;Âµ broad.
The lateral flagellum is stated to be attached to the cell body for a
short distance. Regarding the karyosome in the nucleus, the author
states that the smaller the karyosome the more chromatin is deposited
on the nuclear membrane. Flu mentions that the specific name
<i>javanensis</i> is a temporary one, as in the course of time it may be
shown that there is only one species of <i>Prowazekia</i>.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Prowazekia cruzi</b>, Hartmann and Chagas, 1910.</p>

<p>Found in a culture from human fÃ¦ces on an agar plate in Brazil,
and considered to be a free-living form.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> The organism is oval or
pear-shaped, 8&nbsp;Âµ to 12&nbsp;Âµ long and 5&nbsp;Âµ to 6&nbsp;Âµ broad. In human stools

he thinks is the same as <i>Prowazekia cruzi</i>. He considers it to be a
cause of human diarrhÅa and intestinal catarrh.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Prowazekia weinbergi</b>, Mathis and LÃ©ger, 1910.</p>

<p>This species was found in the fÃ¦ces of men, both healthy and
diarrhÅic, in Tonkin.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> It is pear-shaped, 8&nbsp;Âµ to 15&nbsp;Âµ long by 4&nbsp;Âµ to
6Â·5&nbsp;Âµ broad. The flagella occur at the broad end.</p>

<p>The discoverers think that <i>Prowazekia weinbergi</i> is an intestinal
inhabitant, but non-pathogenic, since it was found to occur in the
fÃ¦ces even when obtained with aseptic precautions.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Prowazekia parva</b>, NÃ¤gler, 1910.</p>

<p>A free-living form found in the slime on the stones at the biological
station at Lunz. Another <i>Prowazekia</i> was found in 1914 in tap-water
in Calcutta.</p>


<p class="spec">Family. <b>TrypanosomidÃ¦</b>, Doflein.</p>

<p>The TrypanosomidÃ¦, broadly considered, are uniflagellate
organisms, the flagellum being at the anterior end. The flagellum
arises near the blepharoplast (kinetic nucleus), which lies anterior,
near or posterior to the nucleus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span></p>

<p>The following genera will be <span class="nowrap">considered:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="ml2hi5"><i>Trypanosoma</i>&mdash;with an undulating membrane along the length
of the body.</p>

<p class="ml2hi5"><i>Crithidia</i>&mdash;with a less well-developed undulating membrane
anteriorly (see fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_49">49</a>).</p>

<p class="ml2hi5"><i>Herpetomonas</i>&mdash;including the so-called <i>Leptomonas</i>, with anterior
free flagellum only, and no undulating membrane.</p>

<p class="ml2hi5"><i>Leishmania</i>&mdash;non-flagellate forms in mammalian blood, flagellate
herpetomonad stages in culture, probably occurring naturally in Arthropods.</p>


<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Trypanosoma</b>, Gruby, 1843.</p>

<p>The members of the genus possess a single flagellum, which
arises posteriorly, adjacent to a blepharoplast or kinetic nucleus. The
flagellum forms a margin to an undulating membrane, and may
or may not be continued beyond the body as a free flagellum.
Many species are parasitic in vertebrate blood and in the digestive
tracts of insects.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Historical.</span></p>

<p>The history of blood flagellates goes back to the year 1841, in which Valentin
discovered in the blood of a brook-trout (<i>Salmo fario</i> L.) minute bodies, from 7&nbsp;Âµ
to 13&nbsp;Âµ in length, with active movements and presenting marked changes in form.
Valentin considered the parasite a new species of the old genus <i>Proteus</i> or
<i>AmÅba</i>, Ehrbg. This announcement led Gluge (1842) to publish a similar discovery
he had made in frogâs blood. The latter forms were called by Mayer (1843) <i>AmÅba
rotatoria</i>, <i>ParamÅcium loricatum</i> and <i>P. costatum</i>, while Gruby (1843) called them
<i>Trypanosoma sanguinis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Later it was discovered that similar organisms occurred
also in the blood of birds (Wedl (1850), Danilewsky) and of mammals. Gros (1845)
found them in the mouse and mole, Chaussat (1850) in the house rat, Lewis (1879) in
the Indian rat, Wittich (1881) in the hamster. Danilewsky (1886â89) and Chalachnikow
(1888) investigated the structure and division of trypanosomes.</p>

<p>In the case of all these forms, there was no discussion as to a pathogenic
influence on the host. Opinion, however, as to the action of trypanosomes
changed when, in 1880, Evans found flagellates in the blood of horses in India
that suffered from a disease endemic there called âsurra,â and associated
the parasites with the disease. Steel and Evans were successful in transmitting
the parasites&mdash;first known as <i>SpirochÃ¦ta evansi</i>, Steel, then as <i>Trichomonas
evansi</i>, Crookshank, and finally as <i>Trypanosoma evansi</i>&mdash;to dogs, mules and horses.
They recognized that the above mentioned flagellates in the blood of the experimental
animals were the causal agents of the disease.</p>

<p>From that time there was a considerable increase in the literature, the
contents of which have been summarized by Laveran and Blanchard. In 1894
Rouget discovered trypanosomes in the blood of African horses that suffer<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
from âstallionâs diseaseâ (dourine). In 1894 Bruce found similar forms (<i>T. brucei</i>) in
the blood of South African mammals suffering from ânagana,â and in consequence
attention was drawn to the part which the much dreaded tsetse-fly played in
the transmission of ânagana.â In 1901 Elmassian discovered trypanosomes in
the blood of horses that were stricken with âmal de caderas,â which is very
common in the Argentine. The disease in cattle named âgalziekteâ (gall-sickness),
occurring in the Transvaal, was also at one time attributed to
a trypanosome remarkable for its great size, and like some other species, bearing
the name of its discoverer (<i>T. theileri</i>).</p>

<p>The study of the species hitherto known has been carried on partly by the
above mentioned authors and in part by others, <i>e.g.</i>, Rabinowitsch and Kempner,
Laveran and Mesnil, Wasiliewski, Senn. It was greatly advanced by the method
of double staining (with alkaline methylene blue and eosin) introduced by
Romanowsky (1891) and elaborated by Ziemann, Leishman, Giemsa and others.
By this means the presence of a terminal flagellum and of an undulating membrane
at the side of the flattened and extended body was demonstrated. Laveran and
Mesnil (1901) discovered allied flagellates in the blood of the fish, <i>Scardinius
erythrophthalmus</i>. These flagellates, now placed in the genus <i>Trypanoplasma</i>, had
a second free flagellum in addition to the one bordering the undulating membrane.
Trypanoplasms have since been found in both freshwater and marine fishes. The
transmission of trypanoplasms of freshwater fishes is effected by leeches. <i>Trypanoplasma
varium</i> from <i>Cobitis</i> is transmitted by <i>Hemiclepsis marginata</i> according to
LÃ©ger, while the Trypanoplasmata of <i>Cyprinus carpio</i> and <i>Abramis brama</i> reach
new hosts by the agency of <i>Piscicola</i> according to Keysselitz.</p>

<p>Another ally of the TrypanosomidÃ¦, <i>Trypanophis</i>, lives in the cÅlenteric
cavity of Siphonophores. It has also an extra terminal flagellum (Poche,
Keysselitz). [<i>Trypanoplasma</i> and <i>Trypanophis</i> belong to the <i>BodonidÃ¦</i>, see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_63">63</a>].</p>

<p>Finally it was shown that Trypanosomes occurred in human beings. Although
Nepveuâs early report of trypanosomes in the blood of malarial patients may be
doubtful, subsequent researches by Forde and Dutton demonstrated trypanosomes
(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_28">28</a>) in the blood of a European, apparently suffering from malaria, living in the
Gambia. Dutton (1902) called the human trypanosome, <i>T. gambiense</i>. The expedition
despatched by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (1902) to Senegambia
found trypanosome infections in six cases among a thousand inhabitants examined.</p>

<p>About the same time attention was devoted to the disease of West African
negroes known for a century as âsleeping sickness.â Castellani (1903) was the
first to succeed in demonstrating the presence of trypanosomes (at first called
<i>T. ugandense</i>) in centrifugalized cerebro-spinal fluid obtained by puncture from cases
of sleeping sickness in Uganda. Similar discoveries were made by Bruce, who also
found trypanosomes in the blood of those attacked with sleeping sickness. Sambon
regarded a species of <i>Glossina</i> as the transmitter. From consideration of the
geographical distribution of the disease Christy regarded <i>Glossina palpalis</i> as the
transmitter. Brumpt first thought it was <i>G. morsitans</i>, but, later, supported the
view of <i>G. palpalis</i>. Bruce, Nabarro and Greig also named the same insect as
the transmitter, not only for geographical reasons but also because healthy apes
became infected by the bite of certain <i>G. palpalis</i>. The inoculation of cerebro-spinal
fluid from subjects of sleeping sickness into the spinal canal of apes (<i>Macacus</i>)
had the same result.</p>

<p>Just as the discovery of the malarial parasites called forth a whole flood
of research memoirs which were followed by a second series on the relation of
the mosquitoes to malaria, so a similar outpouring occurred after the discovery
of the pathogenic trypanosomes of mammals and men. In both cases the inquiry
was not limited to the stages in man and other vertebrate hosts, but the fate<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
of the parasites in the intermediate (invertebrate) hosts was investigated, and
allied species were obtained from many different hosts.</p>

<p>Novy and MacNeal (1903) were the first to cultivate trypanosomes in artificial
media (blood-agar).</p>

<p>In 1910 Stephens and Fantham recorded the presence of another human
trypanosome, <i>T. rhodesiense</i>, from a case of sleeping sickness in Rhodesia, where
<i>G. palpalis</i> was absent. Kinghorn has since demonstrated that <i>T. rhodesiense</i> is
transmitted by <i>G. morsitans</i>. Kinghorn and Yorke believe that big game (<i>e.g.</i>,
antelope) is the reservoir of <i>T. rhodesiense</i>.</p>

<p>The output of literature on trypanosomiasis in men and animals is enormous.
To cope with it the Sleeping <i>Sickness Bureau Bulletin</i> was founded in 1908,
and it is now (since November 1912) continued as a section of the <i>Tropical Diseases
Bulletin</i>, wherein current literature is reviewed.</p></div>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">General.</span></p>

<p>Trypanosomes occur in the blood of representatives of all the
vertebrate classes. Often the trypanosomes occur so scantily in the
blood that they are overlooked on examination. A useful aid in
detecting the flagellates in such cases consists in the use of cultures
of the blood of the host on artificial media. Stimulated by the
medium multiplication occurs, and hence the parasites are more
easily detected. [For the composition of such culture media see
Appendix.]</p>

<p>There is a periodicity in the appearance of the trypanosomes in
the peripheral blood of the host, due to alternating phases of multiplication
and of rest on the part of the parasites. Such periodicity
has been established both by biological and enumerative methods.
Again, a seasonal variation has been observed in the occurrence
of certain trypanosomes in the peripheral circulation of the hosts; for
example, some trypanosomes (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>T. noctuÃ¦</i> in birds) are found only
in the summer in the blood, while in the winter they occur in the
internal organs.</p>

<p>Recent cultural researches have established that trypanosomes, <i>e.g.</i>,
<i>T. americanum</i>, may be present in very small numbers in hosts, such as
cattle, which are quite unharmed by them, and in which the presence
of these flagellates formerly was never suspected (âcryptic trypanosomiasis.â)
However, the majority of the trypanosomes occurring in
domestic animals are usually deleterious or even lethal to their hosts.
Many wild animals, such as various species of antelope, harbour
trypanosomes without being injured thereby. In such cases it is
probable that the vertebrate hosts have been so long parasitized in the
past, that they have become tolerant and immune to the effects of the
flagellates. Should such trypanosomes of wild animals be transmitted
to domesticated stock or man, they may re-acquire their initial virulence
and become pathogenic to the new host. As a general statement,
the newer a parasite is to its host the greater is its virulence.<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
For example, <i>T. gambiense</i>, <i>T. rhodesiense</i> and <i>T. brucei</i> are innocuous
to big game in Africa, but are pathogenic to man and domestic animals
respectively. Pathogenic trypanosomes appear to have a wider range
of hosts, that is, to be less limited to one specific host than non-pathogenic
forms. Thus, <i>T. rhodesiense</i> is pathogenic to man and all
laboratory animals, while it is non-pathogenic to antelopes and their
kind.</p>

<p class="tac"><i>Morphology.</i></p>

<p>The general structure of the various trypanosomes shows much
uniformity, though variations in size and shape occur. Typically the
body is elongate and sinuous. The flagellar end tapers gradually to
a point, the aflagellar extremity usually being rounded or more blunt.
In some trypanosomes there is much diversity in size, the organisms
varying from long, slender forms to short, stumpy ones; in other
species relative constancy of size is maintained. The former are
known as polymorphic trypanosomes, the latter as monomorphic
forms.</p>

</div>

<p>Two nuclei are present. The main or principal nucleus, sometimes
termed the trophic nucleus, is often situated towards the centre
of the body; it is frequently of the vesicular type, containing a
karyosome. The blepharoplast or kinetic nucleus is posterior to the
nucleus, and usually is rod-like. The flagellum arises close to the
blepharoplast, and forms an edge to the undulating membrane.
It may or may not extend beyond the limits of the undulating
membrane. If it does so, the unattached part is known as the free
flagellum. Sometimes a small granule is found at the origin of the
flagellum. This is the basal granule, and is considered by some to
function as the centriole of the kinetic nucleus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span></p>

<p>The undulating membrane is a lateral extension of the ectoplasm
or periplast, and is the main agent in locomotion. It is edged by the
flagellum, which forms a deeply stainable border to it. Within the
membrane substance, often arranged parallel with its edge, are a
number of fine contractile elements, the myonemes. These contractile
elements may also occur on the body of the trypanosome.
They are easily seen in some large trypanosomes, but are difficult of
demonstration in others, owing to their great fineness.</p>

</div>

<p>Multiplication of trypanosomes in the blood is brought about by
binary longitudinal fission (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_26">26</a>). Division is initiated by that of
the blepharoplast and nucleus. The division may be equal or subequal,
whereby differences in size of individuals partly arise. Multiple
division by repeated binary fission, without complete separation of
the daughter forms, is known in some trypanosomes (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>T. lewisi</i>),
and rosettes of parasites thereby are produced (fig.&nbsp;27).</p>

<p>The classification of trypanosomes is very difficult. Laveran
(1911)<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> has suggested the examination of the relative length of the
flagellum as a diagnostic character, and so arranged these flagellates
in mammals in three groups. The first group included those trypanosomes
always having part of the flagellum free (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>T. evansi</i>,
<i>T. vivax</i>); the second group comprised forms without a part of<span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
the flagellum free (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>T. congolense</i>), while the third group included
forms some members of which have free flagella, while others have
not (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>T. gambiense</i>). Bruce<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> (1914) and Yorke and Blacklock<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
(1914) have also devised classifications.</p>

<p>Resting stages of some trypanosomes have been found in the
internal organs of their vertebrate hosts. The formation of these
oval, Leishmania-like bodies will be noted in individual cases later.
Similar small oval bodies form an important phase in the life-history
of <i>T. cruzi</i>, which multiplies normally by multiple fission or schizogony
into these oval, daughter elements, and not by binary longitudinal
fission in the circulating blood.</p>

<p>Polymorphism in trypanosomes (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>T. gambiense</i>, <i>T. rhodesiense</i>)
is now interpreted as a phenomenon resulting from growth and
division.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Long, thin forms are those about to divide. Fully mature
forms are shorter and broader. Various intermediate types occur and
represent growth forms. Formerly, polymorphism was interpreted in
terms of sex, thin forms being regarded as males, broad forms as
females, while the intermediate types were termed indifferent. Conjugation
was not observed, and there is no evidence in support of
the sexual interpretation.</p>

<p>The transmission of trypanosomes from one vertebrate host to
another is usually accomplished by the intermediation of some biting
arthropod in the case of terrestrial animals, while leeches are usually
considered to act as transmitters in the case of the trypanosomes
occurring in aquatic animals. Developmental phases of the life-histories
of trypanosomes occur in the invertebrate transmitters, and
will be considered in individual cases.</p>

<p>In vertebrate blood <i>Trypanosoma gambiense</i> is polymorphic, for
long, thin forms may be seen in contrast with short, stumpy forms,
as well as intermediate forms (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_29">29</a>, <i>a</i>&mdash;<i>c</i>). This polymorphism has
been interpreted in terms of sex, especially by German investigators,
following Schaudinn (see above). However, there is no evidence of
conjugation, and the polymorphic forms are more easily interpreted
in terms of growth and division, for the long thin forms are potential
dividing organisms, and the stumpy or short parasites, with little or
no free flagellum, are the adult individuals.</p>

<p><i>T. gambiense</i> varies from 13&nbsp;Âµ to 36&nbsp;Âµ in length, its average length
being 24Â·8&nbsp;Âµ, as was determined in 1913 by exact biometrical methods
by Stephens and Fantham.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Three forms of parasite occur. According
to Miss Robertson,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> the relatively
short forms from 13&nbsp;Âµ to 21&nbsp;Âµ
long may be regarded as the
mature or âadultâ type of parasite
in the blood. They carry on the
cycle in the vertebrate. From
them intermediate forms, which
are longer than the âadultâ but
at first have the same breadth,
arise by growth. They possess
a free flagellum. The intermediate
forms grow into long individuals,
which are those about to
divide. The products of division give rise, directly or indirectly, to
the adult forms.</p>

</div>

<p>The organism has an elongate body with an anterior or flagellar
end and a blunter posterior or non-flagellar end. The protoplasm
is finely granular, large inclusions being rare. The central nucleus is
oval and large, often containing most of its chromatin concentrated as
a karyosome, with small granules only scattered near or on the fine
nuclear membrane. The blepharoplast is either rounded or rod-<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>shaped.
The undulating membrane is thrown into folds and is
bordered by the flagellum. A small basal granule may be present
near, or at the actual origin of the flagellum.</p>

<p><i>Multiplication</i> in the vertebrate is brought about by longitudinal
division. According to the recent account of division by Miss
Robertson, the blepharoplast doubles, then the flagellum splits for the
greater part of its length, and the daughter flagella separate, one being
shorter than the parent flagellum. The nucleus often shows two well
marked dark granules on the membrane at opposite poles, and these
appear to act as centrosomes. Nuclear constriction occurs and the
halves gradually separate. Finally the two daughter organisms become
free, the aflagellar end splitting last. The products of division may be
equal or unequal. Repeated division goes on in the general circulation
until the blood swarms with parasites. Then the trypanosomes gradually
disappear, and a period occurs when it is practically impossible to
demonstrate the parasite in the blood. At such a period, trypanosomes
can be obtained by puncture of the enlarged lymphatic glands or of
the spinal canal, or can be found in the internal organs, more particularly
in the spleen, lungs, liver and bone-marrow. In the latter
organs, latent bodies are produced (fig.&nbsp;29, <i>d</i>&mdash;<i>f</i>) which are capable of
again becoming flagellates and entering the general circulation.
Their formation was described by Fantham (1911).<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> The parasite
contracts, the blepharoplast migrates towards the nucleus, a very thin
coat differentiates around the two nuclei and a certain amount of cytoplasm,
and the parts exterior to the coat disintegrate, leaving a small,
oval body behind. Fuller details are given in connection with
<i>T. rhodesiense</i>. Laveran (1911)<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> considers that latent bodies are
âinvolutionâ forms, but acknowledges that they can flagellate and
become infective in fresh blood.</p>

<p>No multiplication of the trypanosomes within the cells of the
lung, liver or spleen of infected monkeys was found by Miss
Robertson in her recent researches.</p>

<p>There appear to be negative periods in infected monkeys, since,
although trypanosomes may occur in their blood at such times, they
are not infective to <i>Glossina</i>.</p>

<p><i>Development in Glossina palpalis.</i>&mdash;The principal accounts are
those by Sir D. Bruce and his colleagues (1911),<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> and by Miss
Robertson<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> (1912), whose results will be followed. According to the
latter investigator <i>T. gambiense</i> never enters the body cells of the fly
(<i>G. palpalis</i>), nor does it penetrate the gut wall into the body cavity.
Practically no crithidial stage occurs in the flyâs main gut, but a
trypanosome facies is retained therein.</p>

<p>After the trypanosomes are ingested by the fly during a meal of<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
infected blood, sooner or later multiplication occurs. This development
usually begins in the middle or posterior part of the mid gut,
and trypanosomes of varying sizes are produced. After the tenth
or twelfth day, many long, slender trypanosomes (fig.&nbsp;30, <i>a</i>) are
found, which gradually move forwards into the proventriculus. Such
long, slender forms represent the limit of development in the lumen
of the main gut. The proventricular type, developed about the
eighth to the eighteenth or twentieth day, is not infective; it may
occur in the crop, but is not to be found permanently there.
Between the tenth and the fifteenth days multinucleate forms of
trypanosomes are found, and may be styled multiple forms (fig.&nbsp;30, <i>b</i>).
Some of these latter may be degenerative.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Invasion of the Salivary Glands of the Fly.</i>&mdash;Long, slender trypanosomes
from the proventriculus pass forward into the hypopharynx.
They then pass back along the salivary ducts, about sixteen to thirty
days after the flyâs feed. The trypanosomes reach the salivary glands
as long, slender forms. In the glands they become shorter and
broader, attach themselves to the surrounding structures, and assume
the crithidial facies (fig.&nbsp;30, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>). As crithidial forms they remain
attached to the wall and multiply in the glands. These crithidial
stages differentiate into the short, broad trypanosome forms, capable
of swimming freely (fig.&nbsp;30, <i>e</i>).</p>

<p>Miss Robertson considers the development in the main gut to be
indifferent multiplication, and that salivary fluid seems necessary to
stimulate trypanosomes to the apparently essential reversion to the<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
crithidial type. The second development in the salivary gland is the
essential feature. The short, stumpy forms of trypanosomes (fig.&nbsp;30, <i>e</i>)
finally produced in the salivary glands are alone infective. No
conjugation of trypanosomes occurs in the fly. Only about 5 per
cent. of captive tsetse flies fed on trypanosome-infected blood become
infective, but they probably remain infective for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>J.&nbsp;G. Thomson and Sinton (1912)<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> have obtained in cultures the
various trypanosome forms of <i>T. gambiense</i> seen in the flyâs main gut.</p>

<p>Duke (1912)<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> found <i>T. gambiense</i> in a species of antelope, the
situtunga (<i>Tragelaphus spekei</i>), on Damba Island in Victoria Nyanza.
Wild <i>G. palpalis</i> could be infected therefrom. The antelope may
then act as a sleeping sickness reservoir in that district, but men are
apparently the chief reservoir.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Trypanosoma nigeriense</b>, Macfie, 1913.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>Macfie has recently (August, 1913) described a human trypanosome
from the Eket district of Southern Nigeria. It is common in
young people. The disease produced does not seem to be of a
virulent type in Nigeria, and does not occur in epidemic form. In
the early stages the glands of the neck are enlarged. In the later
stages&mdash;cases of which are rarer&mdash;lethargy appears. The parasite
is a polymorphic trypanosome, morphologically almost indistinguishable
from <i>T. gambiense</i>, though it may be slightly shorter. Macfie
recorded the occurrence in his preparations of a few trypanosomes
appearing to have a flagellum free during their whole length.
Some of the parasites, as seen in a sub-inoculated guinea-pig, are very
small (8&nbsp;Âµ long). Other trypanosomes have their nuclei displaced
somewhat anteriorly. This parasite may only be a variety of
<i>T. gambiense</i>. The parasite is perhaps spread by <i>Glossina tachinoides</i>.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Trypanosoma rhodesiense</b>, Stephens and Fantham, 1910.</p>

<p>The parasite was found in the blood of a young Englishman who
had contracted sleeping sickness in the Luangwa Valley, North-eastern
Rhodesia, in the autumn of 1909. The patient had never
been in an area infested with <i>Glossina palpalis</i>.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Morphology.</i>&mdash;The morphology of the parasite in man and
sub-inoculated rats was studied by Stephens and Fantham in 1910.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
They pointed out a morphological peculiarity in the presence of
certain trypanosomes with posterior nuclei in sub-inoculated animals,
that is, parasites in which the nucleus (trophonucleus) was situated
towards the posterior or aflagellar end, close up to or even beyond the<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
blepharoplast or kinetic nucleus (fig.&nbsp;31, <i>4</i>, <i>5</i>). When the nucleus was
beside the blepharoplast, the former was seen to be kidney-shaped
(fig.&nbsp;31, <i>4</i>). The posterior nuclear forms were of the stout and stumpy
variety, and about 6 per cent. of the stumpy forms were found to have
their nuclei displaced from the centre. The anterior or flagellar end
of these trypanosomes often contained chromatoid granules. <i>T.
rhodesiense</i> varies in length from 12&nbsp;Âµ to 39&nbsp;Âµ<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>; short stumpy forms
vary from 13&nbsp;Âµ to 21&nbsp;Âµ, intermediate forms from 21&nbsp;Âµ to 24&nbsp;Âµ, and long,
slender forms from 25&nbsp;Âµ onwards. The average length is 24Â·1&nbsp;Âµ.</p>

</div>

<p>Certain regular periods occur in the course of the trypanosomiasis
when few or no flagellate trypanosomes are found in the peripheral
blood of the patient or of the sub-inoculated animal. These periods
can be explained in terms of morphology, for the trypanosomes are
capable of assuming a non-flagellate form in the internal organs of the
host, particularly in the lungs and in the spleen. Such forms are
known as âlatentâ or ârestingâ forms. The term âlatent bodyâ
was first used by Moore and Breinl in 1907<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> in connection with
<i>T. gambiense</i>. Fantham<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> (1911) has described the process of formation
of latent from motile forms and the reconversion of the latent
bodies into active flagellates. Fresh preparations of splenic blood
or lung blood containing trypanosomes were made. A trypanosome
gradually withdrew or cast off its flagellum, concentrated its
cytoplasm, and became more or less elongate oval. Nucleus and
blepharoplast approached one another and came to lie more or less
side by side. Then an opaque line often made its appearance around
the nuclear area and differentiated as a slight envelope or covering,
the cytoplasm external to this merely degenerating. The small, oval,
refractile body (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_29">29</a>, <i>d</i>&mdash;<i>f</i>) thus formed was a non-flagellate latent
body, 2&nbsp;Âµ to 4&nbsp;Âµ in diameter, like <i>Leishmania</i> or the non-flagellate,<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
multiplicative forms of <i>T. cruzi</i> (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_34">34</a>), and remains temporarily
inactive in the internal organs of the host. After this period of
inactivity, the non-flagellate body, recuperated by its rest, begins
to elongate again. The nuclei separate. From a small vacuole-like
portion the flagellum differentiates and forces out the ectoplasm,
which assumes the form of the undulating membrane with its
flagellar border. Subsequent growth results in the production of the
typical trypanosome form, which re-enters the circulating blood and
multiplies by longitudinal binary fission. Division of the parasite
prior to the formation of a latent body may occur and division
of the latent forms themselves is known, though less common.
Consequently latent bodies, like the flagellate forms themselves,
show diversity in size. The blepharoplast of the latent bodies is
sometimes less well marked than in <i>Leishmania</i> (see fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_29">29</a>, <i>d</i>-<i>f</i>).
Laveranâs views on these bodies have already been given on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_74">74</a>.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Animal Reactions.</i>&mdash;The posterior nuclear trypanosomes were
found in all sub-inoculated animals, such as rats, guinea-pigs, dogs,
mice, Macacus, rabbits and horses, but were not seen in the human
patient, as few trypanosomes occurred in his peripheral blood.
R. Ross and D. Thomson<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> found a periodic, cyclical variation in the
number of the parasites in the patientâs blood from day to day, the
cyclical period being about a week (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_32">32</a>). Fantham and J.&nbsp;G.
Thomson<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> (1911) found a similar periodic, cyclical variation in the trypanosomes
in the blood of sub-inoculated rats, guinea-pigs and rabbits.
On counting the parasites in the blood of similar animals inoculated
with <i>T. gambiense</i>, they established, by enumerative methods, that
<i>T. rhodesiense</i> was more virulent than <i>T. gambiense</i>, while Yorke also
showed this marked virulence of <i>T. rhodesiense</i> in practically all
laboratory animals. In other words the duration of infection in the
case of <i>T. rhodesiense</i> was shorter. It was also found that <i>T. rhodesiense</i>
was resistant to atoxyl. The patient, from whom the original
strain was obtained, died about nine months after the probable date
of infection. Some patients infected with <i>T. rhodesiense</i> have died in
an even shorter period, such as four or five months.</p>

<p>In sheep and goats <i>T. rhodesiense</i> causes an acute disease, marked
by high fever, Ådema of the face, and keratitis, as shown by Bevan
and others, death resulting after a relatively short period. <i>T. gambiense</i>
gives rise, in these animals, to no symptoms except fever, which
may be overlooked. <i>T. rhodesiense</i> produces keratitis in dogs.</p>

Rhodesian sleeping sickness. (After R. Ross and D. Thomson.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Stannus and Yorke (1911) observed <i>T. rhodesiense</i> in animals
inoculated from a case of sleeping sickness in Nyasaland. Sir D. Bruce
and his colleagues<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> have shown (1912) that <i>T. rhodesiense</i> is the<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span><span class="pagenum hide" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
parasite usually found in man and in animals sub-inoculated from
cases of sleeping sickness in Nyasaland. It has since been found in
German East Africa and Portuguese East Africa, while Ellacombe
has described a case from North-western Rhodesia.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Serum Reactions.</i>&mdash;Interesting experiments on this subject were
performed during 1911 and 1912 by various French investigators.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Action of Immune Serum</i> (Mesnil and Ringenbach)<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>: (1) A goat
was infected with <i>T. rhodesiense</i>. Twenty-two days later its serum
mixed with <i>T. rhodesiense</i> was injected into a mouse. Result: Protection.
(2) The serum mixed with <i>T. gambiense</i> was injected into
a mouse. Result: Infection.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Action of Baboon Serum.</i>&mdash;Contrary to <i>T. gambiense</i>, <i>T. rhodesiense</i>
is very susceptible to human and baboon sera. Mesnil and
Ringenbach<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> showed that a dose of <span class="smcap">1 c.c.</span> of baboon (<i>Papio anubis</i>)
serum cured mice infected with <i>T. rhodesiense</i>. In the same dose it
acted very feebly on <i>T. gambiense</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Action of Human Serum.</i>&mdash;<i>1 c.c.</i> of human serum cured <i>T.
rhodesiense</i> mice in three out of four cases; on <i>T. gambiense</i> mice
there was no appreciable effect.</p>

<p>Laveran and Nattan-Larrier<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> have shown the same, namely, that
human sera act on <i>T. rhodesiense</i>, but are quite without action on
<i>T. gambiense</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Trypanolytic Reactions.</i>&mdash;Mesnil and Ringenbach<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> have also
shown that the sera of animals (man, monkey and guinea-pig)
infected with <i>T. gambiense</i> are trypanolytic for the homologous
trypanosome, that is, <i>T. gambiense</i>, but have no action on the heterologous
trypanosome, that is, <i>T. rhodesiense</i>.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Cross Immunity Experiments.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Mesnil and Ringenbach<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
immunized a monkey (<i>Macacus rhesus</i>) against <i>T. gambiense</i>. It was
inoculated with <i>T. rhodesiense</i> on June 7, 1911; on June 27 trypanosomes
appeared, the infection being slight; on July 4 it died. A
control died in ten and a half days.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Laveran<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> immunized a goat and mice against <i>T. gambiense</i>.
When they had acquired a solid immunity, they were inoculated with
<i>T. rhodesiense</i>. They became infected like the controls.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Laveran and Nattan-Larrier<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> immunized a ram against <i>T. brucei</i>,
it subsequently became infected with <i>T. rhodesiense</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Laveran<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> immunized a ram and a sheep against different strains
of T<i>. brucei</i>. Inoculated with <i>T. rhodesiense</i> they both acquired acute
infections and died. Conclusion: <i>T. rhodesiense</i> is not <i>T. brucei</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span></p>
<p>When the converse set of experiments is tried, namely, immunizing
an animal against <i>T. rhodesiense</i>, and then inoculating with
<i>T. gambiense</i>, the difficulty immediately arises that it is impossible to
immunize an animal against <i>T. rhodesiense</i>, owing to its virulence.
But a partial and transitory immunity to <i>T. rhodesiense</i> can be obtained
by treating the infected animal with drugs, such as arsenophenylglycin.
The results, so far as they go, seem to show that an animal immunized
against <i>T. rhodesiense</i> is immune not only to <i>T. rhodesiense</i>, but also
to <i>T. gambiense</i>, a fact which, according to Mesnil and LÃ©ger, does
not invalidate the specificity of <i>T. rhodesiense</i>, but tends to show that
the two trypanosomes are closely related.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Mode of Transmission and Reservoir.</i>&mdash;Kinghorn has shown that
<i>T. rhodesiense</i> is transmitted by <i>Glossina morsitans</i> in which it undergoes
development. Kinghorn and Yorke<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> found that about 16 per
cent. of the wild game examined in Northern Rhodesia was naturally
infected with <i>T. rhodesiense</i>. The wild game examined included waterbuck,
hartebeest, mpala, bushbuck and warthogs. One native dog near
the Nyasaland border was found infected, but not domestic stock.
Taute doubts whether <i>T. rhodesiense</i> really occurs in wild game.
Approximately 3Â·5 per cent. of the tsetse flies fed on infected animals
may become permanently infected with <i>T. rhodesiense</i>, and capable
of infecting clean animals. Furthermore, a tsetse fly when once
infective probably remains infective for the rest of its life.</p>

<p>Kinghorn and Yorke, however, have shown that climatic conditions,
namely, those of temperature, also affect the infectivity of the
tsetse fly, as the ratio of flies capable of transmitting <i>T. rhodesiense</i> to
those incapable of transmitting the virus is 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;534 in hot valley
districts (<i>e.g.</i>, Nawalia, Luangwa Valley, temperature 75Â° to 85Â°&nbsp;F.),
while on elevated plateaux (<i>e.g.</i>, Ngoa, on the Congo-Zambesi watershed,
temperature 60Â° to 70Â°&nbsp;F.) the ratio falls to 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1312.</p>

<p>Mechanical transmission by the tsetse fly does not occur, if
a period of twenty-four hours has elapsed since the infecting meal.</p>

<p><i>Developmental Cycle in the Fly.</i>&mdash;The period which elapses between
the infecting feed of the flies and the date on which they become
infective varies from eleven to twenty-five days in the Luangwa
Valley, according to Kinghorn and Yorke. Attempts carried out at
laboratory temperature on the Congo-Zambesi plateau, during the
cold season, to transmit <i>T. rhodesiense</i> by means of <i>G. morsitans</i>
were always unsuccessful. The developmental cycle of the trypanosome
in the fly is influenced by the temperature to which the flies
are subjected (as stated above). The first portion of the developmental
cycle proceeds at the lower temperatures (60Â° to 70Â°&nbsp;F.), but
higher temperatures are necessary for the completion of the development
<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>of the trypanosome. Kinghorn and Yorke found that the
trypanosomes may persist in the fly, at an incomplete stage of their
development, for at least sixty days when the climatic conditions
were unfavourable.</p>

<p>The first portion of the developmental cycle of the trypanosome
takes place in the gut of the fly. Invasion of the salivary glands of
the tsetse is secondary to that of the intestine, but is necessary for the
infectivity of the fly. A relatively high mean temperature, 75Â° to
85Â°&nbsp;F., is essential for the passage of the trypanosomes into the
salivary glands and the completion of their development therein.</p>

<p>Kinghorn and Yorke<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> state that the predominant type of trypanosome
in the intestine of infected <i>G. morsitans</i> was a large broad form,
quite different from that which is most common in the salivary
glands. The trypanosome in the glands resembles the short form
seen in the blood of the vertebrate host. The authors quoted state
that both the intestinal and salivary gland forms of infective <i>G.
morsitans</i> are virulent when inoculated into healthy animals.</p>

<p>Bruce and colleagues<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> have quite recently (June, 1914) published
an account of their investigations of <i>T. rhodesiense</i> in <i>G. morsitans</i>
in Nyasaland. (Incidentally it may be remarked that Bruce considers
<i>T. rhodesiense</i> to be identical with a polymorphic strain of <i>T. brucei</i>&mdash;see
pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_83">83</a>, <a href="#Page_94">94</a>). The development of <i>T. rhodesiense</i> takes place in the
alimentary canal and salivary glands, not in the proboscis, of the
tsetse fly. In feeding experiments with laboratory bred flies, as
well as with a few wild flies, fed on infected dogs or monkeys, only
8 per cent. of the flies were found to be infected on dissection. Of
such infected flies, however, only some allow of the complete development
of the trypanosomes within them, in other words only about
1 per cent of the flies become <i>infective</i>. The length of time which
elapses before a fly becomes infective varies from fourteen to thirty-one
days, averaging twenty-three days, when kept at 84Â°&nbsp;F. (29Â°&nbsp;C.).
The dominant intestinal type of flagellate in the fly is that seen in
the proventriculus, which contains many long, slender trypanosomes.
These proventricular forms find their way to the salivary glands,
wherein crithidial and encysted forms are seen. They change into
âblood forms,â which are short, stumpy trypanosomes and are
infective. âThe infective type of trypanosome in the salivary glands&mdash;corresponding
to the final stage of the cycle of development&mdash;is
similar to the short and stumpy form found in the blood of the vertebrate
host.â The cycle is thus very similar to that of <i>T. gambiense</i> in
<i>G. palpalis</i> (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_30">30</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culture.</span>&mdash;J.&nbsp;G. Thomson (1912),<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> and subsequently Thomson<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
and Sinton, succeeded in cultivating <i>T. rhodesiense</i> in a modified
Novy-MacNeal medium. The development obtained resembled that
of the trypanosome in the intestine of <i>Glossina</i>.</p>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">General Note on Trypanosomes with Posterior Nuclei.</span></p>

<p>Posteriorly placed nuclei have been found to occur not only in
<i>T. rhodesiense</i> by Stephens and Fantham (1910), but also in <i>T. pecaudi</i>
by Wenyon (1912), in <i>T. brucei</i> by Blacklock (1912), and in <i>T. equiperdum</i>
by Yorke and Blacklock (1912).</p>

<p>Recently Stephens and Blacklock (1913)<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> have shown that two
trypanosomes, different morphologically, have been confused under
the name <i>T. brucei</i>. One of these is polymorphic (<i>i.e.</i>, it exhibits
long and slender as well as short and stumpy forms) and came from
Uganda, while the other is monomorphic and is the original Zululand
strain described by Bruce from cattle suffering from ânagana.â Bruce
(1914) considers that morphological change has occurred in <i>T. brucei</i>
in its passage through laboratory animals, and thus explains the
diversity of views. The posterior nuclear forms described by
Blacklock occurred in the Uganda strain of <i>T. brucei</i>. (See p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_95">95</a>.)
Similarly, a posterior nuclear form, <i>T. equi</i>, has been separated from
<i>T. equiperdum</i>. (See p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_98">98</a>.)</p>

<p>Again, Bruce and his colleagues on the Royal Society Commission
investigating sleeping sickness in Nyasaland, have stated (April,
1913) that âevidence is accumulating that <i>T. rhodesiense</i> and <i>T. brucei</i>
(Plimmer and Bradford) are identical.â The exact identity of trypanosomes
showing posterior nuclei is, then, far from settled, although
Laveran by cross immunity tests has declared that <i>T. brucei</i> is distinct
from <i>T. rhodesiense</i>. No one has yet seen posterior nuclei in <i>T. gambiense</i>.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Trypanosoma cruzi</b>, Chagas, 1909.</p>

<p class="syn">Syn.: <i>Schizotrypanum cruzi</i>, Chagas, 1909.</p>

<p>The trypanosome was discovered by Chagas<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> in the intestine of
the bug, <i>Triatoma</i> (<i>Conorhinus</i>) <i>megista</i>, in Brazil, and then in the
blood of a small monkey bitten by the bug. A little later it was found
in the blood of a child, aged two years, suffering from irregular fever,
extreme anÃ¦mia and enlarged glands in the State of Minas Geraes,
Brazil. Chagas found that he was able to infect many of the usual
laboratory animals with the trypanosome, by allowing the bug to bite
them. He was also able to culture the parasite on blood agar.</p>

<p>Chagas found the Reduviid bug, <i>Triatoma megista</i>, in the houses
of the poorer inhabitants of the Brazilian mining State, and that it
attacked the people, more especially the children, at night, biting the
face. On this account the insect is called âbarbeiroâ by the<span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
inhabitants. The bite is somewhat painful. The disease has since
been found in other parts of Brazil, <i>e.g.</i>, Matta de SÃ£o JoÃ£o in Bahia
province, Goyaz, Matto Grosso and SÃ£o Paulo provinces, as well as
in Minas Geraes.</p>

<p><i>Morphology.</i>&mdash;The trypanosome has a large blepharoplast or kinetic
nucleus. It is stated to occur both free and in the red blood corpuscles
in the peripheral blood. It is about 20&nbsp;Âµ long, on an average.</p>

<p>Two forms of the parasite (fig.&nbsp;33, <i>6</i>, <i>7</i>) are described in the human
blood. In one free form there is a large egg-shaped blepharoplast
and the posterior (aflagellar) end of the parasite is drawn out. The
blepharoplast (kinetic nucleus) may have a chromatin appendage.
The nucleus is oval or band-like, containing a karyosome. The
flagellum, starting close to the blepharoplast or its appendage, has a
free portion of variable length. The other free form in the blood has
a more or less round, terminal blepharoplast, smaller than in the first
form, without a chromatin appendage as a rule. The body of this
second form is decidedly broader than that of the first mentioned.</p>

</div>

<p>The dimorphism has been interpreted sexually, the first mentioned
forms being termed males, the second ones females. The correctness
of this interpretation is very doubtful.</p>

<p>No sign of longitudinal division was ever seen in the peripheral
blood or in the internal organs. The âendocorpuscularâ forms may
be completely or partially enclosed in the red cell or only attached
thereto (fig.&nbsp;33, <i>1</i>-<i>5</i>). At the beginning of infection the endocorpuscular
forms are the more numerous. Some authorities, however,
doubt these stages.</p>

<p><i>Life-history in the Vertebrate Host.</i>&mdash;Chagas found fluctuations in
the number of the parasites in the peripheral blood. He believes the
increase of the parasites to be periodic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span></p>

<p>The investigations of Chagas and of Hartmann have revealed two
types of multiplication which take place in the internal organs of the
vertebrate host.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The first type&mdash;which possibly belongs to another organism,
<i>Pneumocystis carinii</i>, see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_90">90</a>&mdash;occurs in the capillaries of the lungs.
The flagellate parasite entering the lung capillaries loses its flagellum
and undulating membrane. Its body becomes curved, and the two
ends fuse, and so an oval mass is formed (fig.&nbsp;33, <i>8</i>-<i>11</i>). In some
cases the blepharoplast disappears, in other cases it blends or fuses
with the nucleus. The nucleus of the rounded parasite then divides
into eight by successive divisions (fig.&nbsp;33, <i>12</i>-<i>15</i>). Next the body,
which is surrounded by its own periplast, also divides, giving rise
to eight tiny daughter individuals or merozoites (fig.&nbsp;33, <i>15</i>). The
merozoites lie inside the periplast, which acts as a sort of âcyst
wall.â The merozoites are said to exhibit dimorphism, and Chagas
has interpreted the dimorphism in terms of sex. The daughter forms,
produced by the parent trypanosomes which kept their blepharoplasts,
themselves have blepharoplasts as well as nuclei, and have been termed
âmalesâ or âmicrogametes.â The merozoites, arising from parent
trypanosomes which lost their blepharoplasts, have themselves only
nuclei, and have been called âfemalesâ or âmacrogametes.â In the
case of the so-called âfemaleâ forms the single nucleus divides into
two unequal parts, of which the smaller becomes the blepharoplast,
and a flagellum is formed later. The so-called âmalesâ possess early
a rudiment of a flagellum. Both kinds of merozoites escape from the
parent periplast wall, and enter red blood corpuscles. They grow into
flagellates within the corpuscles, and then become
free as adult trypanosomes in the blood-stream.</p>

</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The second mode of multiplication
is one of asexual reproduction (schizogony
or agamogony). It was first described by
Hartmann from hypertrophied endothelial cells
of the lungs. It has since been found in the
cardiac muscle, in the neuroglia of the central
nervous system, and in striped muscle (fig.&nbsp;34).
In laboratory animals it has also been found
in the testicle and suprarenal capsules. In
these tissues the parasite is intracellular, appearing
as a small rounded body with nucleus
and blepharoplast, without flagellum or undulating
membrane. In other words the parasite is <i>Leishmania</i>-like in
the body tissues, and recalls the organism of kala-azar.</p>

<p>Chagas considers this second mode of multiplication to be strictly
asexual. By this means the number of parasites in the vertebrate<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
host is increased, and symptoms are produced. On the other hand
the first mode of multiplication, seen in the lung capillaries, is
considered by Chagas to be a process of gametogony, in which sexual
forms are differentiated. He finds that (1) the adult trypanosomes
exhibit a dimorphism in human blood rarely seen in artificially
infected guinea-pigs. In these guinea-pigs (infected from guinea-pigs)
the so-called gametogony in the lungs is seldom seen. (2) The
intermediate host, <i>Triatoma</i> (<i>Conorhinus</i>), becomes infective if fed
directly on infected human blood, but very rarely so if fed on guinea-pigs.
Chagas is led to believe that the occurrence of sexual forms
constantly in the blood of man implies a greater resistance to infection
on the part of man than on the part of guinea-pigs or other animals,
assuming the general hypothesis that the formation of gametes
represents a reaction of the ProtozoÃ¶n to unfavourable conditions.
In human infection the number of parasites is always less than in
laboratory animals, and their presence in the blood is transitory,
lasting from fifteen to thirty days in acute cases. In many cases
examination of the tissues at death has shown the presence of parasites
in patients who did not exhibit them in the general circulation.</p>

the mid gut of <i>Triatoma</i>; <i>7</i> flagellate forms found in the posterior part of the gut of <i>Triatoma</i>.
(After Chagas.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>Life History in the Invertebrate Host.</i>&mdash;About six hours after the
ingestion of infected blood by the bug (<i>Triatoma megista</i>), the kinetic
nucleus of the trypanosome moves towards the nucleus, and the
flagellum is usually lost (fig.&nbsp;35, <i>1</i>-<i>5</i>). The parasite becomes rounded
and <i>Leishmania</i>-like (fig.&nbsp;35, <i>3</i>-<i>5</i>), and multiplies rapidly by division.
After a time, multiplication having ceased, the rounded forms become
pear-shaped and develop a flagellum at the more pointed end.
Crithidial forms (fig.&nbsp;35, 7) are thus produced and pass into the intestine,
where they multiply and may be seen in about twenty-five hours
after the ingestion of blood. The crithidial forms may also be
found in the rectum and fÃ¦ces. The last stage in the invertebrate
is a small, trypanosome-like type, long and thin with a band-like
nucleus and conspicuous kinetic nucleus. These parasites are found
in the hind gut and in the body cavity. They find their way into
the salivary glands, and are the forms (fig.&nbsp;36) which are transmissible<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
to a new vertebrate host. The development in the bug takes about
eight days altogether, after which time the bugs are infective.</p>

<p>There are thus three principal
phases in the development
of <i>T. cruzi</i> in <i>Triatoma
megista</i>: (1) A multiplicative
phase (<i>Leishmania</i>-like) in the
stomach of the bug, (2) a
crithidial phase, which is also
multiplicative, in the hind-gut,
and (3) a trypanosome phase, which is âpropagative,â and apparently
passes through the wall of the alimentary canal into the body cavity
and so into the salivary glands.</p>

<p>Brumpt found that <i>T. cruzi</i> could live in <i>Cimex lectularius</i>, <i>C. boueti</i>,
and <i>Ornithodorus moubata</i>. The <i>Cimex</i> fÃ¦ces may be infective.
Blacklock found multiplication of the parasite in <i>C. lectularius</i>.</p>

<p><i>Culture.</i>&mdash;The trypanosome can be cultivated on Novy-MacNealâs
blood agar, and the cultural forms resemble those described in
the bug.</p>

<p><i>Possible Reservoir.</i>&mdash;Chagas thinks that probably the armadillo or
âtatuâ (<i>Dasypus novemcinctus</i>) may be the reservoir of <i>T. cruzi</i>. He
also thinks that <i>Triatoma geniculata</i> is a transmitter; it lives in the
burrows of the armadillo. Other carriers may be <i>Triatoma infestans</i>
and <i>T. sordida</i>.</p>

<p><i>Clinical Features.</i>&mdash;The trypanosomiasis of Brazil, produced by
<i>T. cruzi</i> and spread by <i>Triatoma</i> spp. has received various names,
such as oppilaÃ§Ã£o, canguary, parasitic thyroiditis, and coreotrypanosis.
It is also known as the human trypanosomiasis of Brazil, South
American trypanosomiasis, and Chagasâ disease.</p>

<p>Chagas<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> reports two principal forms&mdash;acute and chronic. The
<i>acute infection</i> is rare, and is characterized by increase in the volume
of the thyroid gland, pyrexia, a sensation of crackling in the skin,
enlarged lymphatic glands in the neck, axilla, etc., while the liver and
spleen are increased in volume. Sclerosis of the thyroid gland is
found at autopsy and fatty degeneration of the liver. During an
attack of fever, trypanosomes are found in the blood. The acute
form was only observed in children.</p>

<p><i>In the chronic form</i> Chagas reports several varieties: (<i>a</i>) A
pseudo-myxÅdematous form, occurring in most cases, especially up
to the age of 15. There is hypertrophy of the thyroid gland or
at least signs of hypothyroidism, general hypertrophy of glands,<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>
disturbance of heart rhythm, and nervous symptoms. (<i>b</i>) The myxÅdematous
form is characterized by similar symptoms, especially by
considerable swelling of the thyroid body, and myxÅdema of the
subcutaneous cellular tissue; sometimes there is a true pachydermic
cachexia. (<i>c</i>) In the nervous form there are motor disturbances,
aphasia, disturbances of intelligence or signs of infantilism, athetosis
of the extremities and idiocy. There are also paralytic symptoms of
bulbar origin, disturbances of mastication, phonation and deglutition,
and in some cases convulsive attacks. (<i>d</i>) The cardiac form, characterized
by disturbance of the heart rhythm. In all these forms the
parasite is found at autopsy in the nervous substance, brain, bulb and
heart.</p>

<p>Vianna (1911)<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> has studied the histopathology of the disease.
Some of the chief points are: in the heart muscle destruction of
the sarcoplasm, followed by interstitial myocarditis; in the central
nervous system invasion of the neuroglia cells and inflammatory
reaction; in the suprarenal capsule invasion of medulla or cortex;
inflammatory reaction can also be seen in the kidneys, the hypophysis
and thyroid gland.</p>

<p>Recently Chagas states<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> that âschizotrypanosomiasisâ has been
found in a child 15 to 20 days old, and that <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>
has also been found in a fÅtus&mdash;the mother being infected with
the trypanosome. The trypanosomiasis can, then, be transmitted
hereditarily.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Trypanosoma lewisi</b>, Kent, 1881.</p>

<p>The trypanosome has a nucleus somewhat displaced anteriorly, about
one-third of the way from the anterior (flagellar) end of the body, a
relatively straight edge to the undulating membrane, and a rod-shaped
blepharoplast (fig.&nbsp;37, A). It averages about 25&nbsp;Âµ long and 1Â·5&nbsp;Âµ broad.</p>

<p>Much attention has been devoted in recent years to the elucidation
of the life history of the rat parasite, <i>Trypanosoma lewisi</i>. It is
usually non-pathogenic to its host. It has been shown that the
trypanosome can be transmitted from rat to rat by the rat-flea,
<i>Ceratophyllus fasciatus</i>, and by <i>Ctenocephalus canis</i> (the so-called dog-flea).
(See also p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_92">92</a>). The flagellate may also persist, but doubtfully
develop, in the rat-louse, <i>HÃ¦matopinus spinulosus</i>. These researches
may now be summarized.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Life Cycle in the Vertebrate Host.</i>&mdash;After infection of a rat, the
trypanosomes usually appear in the animalâs blood in five to seven
days. This incubation period applies either to a natural or an artificial
infection. The trypanosomes first observed in the ratâs blood are
diverse in form (fig.&nbsp;37), being small, medium and large in size. This
diversity is explained by the rapid multiplication taking place. A<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
trypanosome may divide by equal longitudinal fission (fig.&nbsp;37, C, D),
but more commonly multiple fission occurs (fig.&nbsp;37, G, H), and is
unequal. Rosette forms are produced, in which the parent form can
be recognized by its long flagellum (fig.&nbsp;37, H) and attached to it are
daughter individuals, smaller in size, from which flagella are growing.
Minchin and J.&nbsp;D. Thomson (1912) find that the daughter forms may
be set free sometimes with a crithidia-like facies (fig.&nbsp;37, I), the
blepharoplast being anterior but near to the nucleus. The daughter<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
forms, when set free, may themselves divide by binary or multiple
fission, in the latter case forming rosettes (fig.&nbsp;37, K). Rosette
forms were described by Moore, Breinl and Hindle in 1908.</p>

<p>Lingard, some years ago, described as a distinct species, <i>T. longocaudense</i>,
certain forms with markedly elongate posterior ends
(fig.&nbsp;37, E). According to Minchin, âthese forms appear to arise by
binary fissionâ (fig.&nbsp;37, D). These long drawn-out forms âare of
constant occurrence and very numerous at a certain stage of the
multiplication period.â It is about the eighth or tenth day after
infection that the multiplication of <i>T. lewisi</i> is at its maximum in the
ratâs blood. About the twelfth or thirteenth day the trypanosomes
seen in the blood appear uniform. According to Minchin (1912)<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
the rat âgets rid of its infection entirely sooner or later, without
having suffered, apparently, any marked inconvenience from it, and
is then immune against a fresh infection with this species of trypanosome.â
There is, then, a cycle of development in the vertebrate host.
Minchin notes that the records of the pathogenicity of <i>T. lewisi</i> in
rats, causing their death, need further investigation.</p>

<p><i>T. lewisi</i> inoculated into dormice (<i>Myoxus nitela</i>) and jerboas may
become pathogenic thereto.</p>

<p>Carini found cysts in the lungs of rats infected with <i>T. lewisi</i>.
He thought the cysts were schizogonic stages of the trypanosome,
comparable with those found in the lungs of animals sub-inoculated
with <i>T. cruzi</i>. DelanoÃ« (1912)<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> has found, however, that such
cysts, containing eight vermicules, occurred in rats uninfected with
<i>T. lewisi</i>. DelanoÃ« concludes that the pneumocysts are independent
of <i>T. lewisi</i>, and represent a new parasite, <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i>. The
pneumocysts may be allied to the Coccidia, and must be considered
when investigating the life-cycle of a trypanosome in a vertebrate
host. Some of the stages of <i>T. cruzi</i> may possibly be of this nature.</p>

<p><i>Life-cycle in the Invertebrate Host.</i>&mdash;This occurs in fleas, and has
been investigated in considerable detail by Minchin and Thomson
in <i>Ceratophyllus fasciatus</i>, and by NÃ¶ller in <i>Ctenocephalus canis</i> and
<i>Ctenopsylla musculi</i>.</p>

<p>When infected ratâs blood is taken up by the flea, the parasites pass
with the ingested blood direct to the mid-gut of the Siphonapteran.
In the fleaâs stomach they multiply in a somewhat remarkable manner,
namely, by penetration of the cells of the lining epithelium, and
division inside the epithelial cells. Inside these lining cells the
trypanosomes first grow to a large size and then form large spherical
bodies, within which nuclear multiplication occurs (fig.&nbsp;38, A-F).
Any one of these large spherical bodies contains at first a number of
nuclei, blepharoplasts and developing flagella, the original flagellum<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
still remaining attached for a time. The cytoplasm then divides into
daughter trypanosomes which are contained within an envelope,
formed by the periplast of the parent parasite. Inside the periplast
envelope are a number of daughter trypanosomes âwriggling very
actively; the envelope becomes more and more tense, and finally
bursts with explosive suddenness, setting free the flagellates, usually
about eight in number, within the host-cellâ (fig.&nbsp;38, F). The daughter
forms escaping from the host cell into the stomach lumen of the flea
are fully formed, long trypanosomes.</p>

Ã 2,000. (After Minchin.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The trypanosomes (fig.&nbsp;38, G) pass into the fleaâs rectum. The
next phase is a crithidial one. The parasites become pear-shaped,
in which the blepharoplast (kinetic nucleus) has travelled anteriorly
past the nucleus towards the flagellum (fig.&nbsp;39). The crithidial forms
attach themselves to the wall of the rectum, and multiply by binary
fission (fig.&nbsp;39, D). A stock of parasites is thus formed which,
according to Minchin and Thomson, âpersist for a long time in
the flea&mdash;probably under favourable conditions, for the whole life
of the insectâ (fig.&nbsp;39, A&ndash;I).</p>

<p>From the crithidial forms of the rectum, according to Minchin,
small infective trypanosomes arise by modification morphologically
(fig.&nbsp;39, J&ndash;M). The flagellum grows longer and draws out more the
anterior part of the body, the blepharoplast migrates posteriorly,
behind the nucleus, and carries with it the flagellar origin. These
trypanosomes are small, but broad and stumpy (fig.&nbsp;39, N), and can<span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>
infect a rat. Minchin and Thomson formerly considered that the
small, stumpy, infective trypanosomes pass forwards from the rectum
into the stomach, and âappear to be regurgitated into the ratâs blood
when the flea feeds.â However, the small infective trypanosomes
were previously described by Swellengrebel and Strickland.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> They
may be found in the fleaâs fÃ¦ces. NÃ¶ller (1912)<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> has found that the
development of <i>T. lewisi</i> proceeds quite well in the dog flea (<i>Ctenocephalus
canis</i>) in Germany. Wenyon confirms this, and states that
the human flea, <i>Pulex irritans</i>, and the Indian rat-flea, <i>Xenopsylla
cheopis</i>, are also able to serve as true hosts for <i>T. lewisi</i>.</p>

<p>NÃ¶ller stated that rats were not infected with <i>T. lewisi</i> by infective
fleas biting them, but by the rats licking up the fÃ¦ces passed by the
fleas while feeding. This is not in agreement with Minchin and
Thomsonâs earlier views of regurgitation, which, apparently, they
have now abandoned.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> Wenyon (1912) confirms NÃ¶llerâs experiments.
He took a dog flea, containing infective trypanosomes in
its fÃ¦ces, and allowed it to feed on a clean rat. The fÃ¦ces of the
flea, passed while feeding, were carefully âcollected on a cover glass
and taken up in culture fluid with a fine glass pipette.â The contents
of the pipette were discharged into the mouth of a second clean rat.
Injury to the ratâs mouth was carefully avoided. The first rat, on
which the infective flea was fed, did not become infected, while the<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
second rat, in whose mouth infective flea fÃ¦ces were placed, became
infected in six days.</p>

<p>When infective forms of <i>T. lewisi</i> have been developed within the
gut of a rat flea, they may enter and infect the vertebrate host
by<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> (<i>a</i>) being crushed and eaten by the rodent; (<i>b</i>) the rat may lick
its fur on which an infected flea has just passed infective excrement;
or (<i>c</i>) the rat may lick, and infect with flea excrement, the wound
produced by the bite of the flea.</p>

<p>The time taken for the full development of <i>T. lewisi</i> in the flea
is about six days. The intracellular phase is at its height about
the end of the first day; the crithidial phase, in the fleaâs rectum,
begins during the second day; the stumpy, infective trypanosomes
are developed in the rectum about the end of the fifth day.</p>

<p>Wenyon<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> writes that, âthe fleas, when once infected with <i>T. lewisi</i>,
remain infected for long periods, for though many small infective
trypanosomes are washed out of the gut at each feed, those that
remain behind multiply to re-establish the infection of the hind gut.
Further, the infection is still maintained even if the flea is nourished
on a human being, so that fresh human blood does not appear to be
destructive to the infective forms in the flea.â</p>

<p>The best method of controlling fleas during experiments is that
due to NÃ¶ller. He adopted the method of showmen who exhibit
performing fleas, and secure them on very fine silver wire.</p>

<p>Of fleas fed on an infected rat only about 20 per cent. become
infective. About 80 per cent. are immune. If fleas are examined
twenty-four hours after feeding, trypanosomes will be found in all, so
that many of the parasites are destined to degenerate.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to note that Gonder<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> (1911) has shown that
a strain of <i>T. lewisi</i> resistant to arsenophenylglycin loses its resistance
after passage through the rat-louse, <i>HÃ¦matopinus spinulosus</i>. These
experiments suggest that physiological âacquired charactersâ may
be lost by passage through an invertebrate host.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Trypanosoma brucei</b>, Plimmer and Bradford, 1899.</p>

<p><i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> was discovered by Sir D. Bruce in 1894 in
cattle in Zululand and was named <i>T. brucei</i> by Plimmer and Bradford
in 1899 in honour of its discoverer. This trypanosome is of considerable
economic importance, as it is responsible for the fatal
tsetse fly disease, or ânagana,â in cattle, horses and dogs. The
disease is widely distributed in Africa and is transmitted from host to
host by the tsetse, <i>Glossina morsitans</i>, and other species of <i>Glossina</i>.<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
The virus is maintained in nature in certain big game, such as wildebeest,
bushbuck and koodoo, which thus act as living reservoirs of
disease from which the tsetse may become infected. These reservoir
hosts are not injured, apparently, by the presence of the parasites.</p>

<p><i>T. brucei</i> is rapidly fatal to the small laboratory animals, such as
rats and mice. Horses, asses and dogs practically always succumb
to its attacks, while a very small number of cattle recover from
ânagana.â The disease is characterized by fever, destruction of red
blood corpuscles, severe emaciation and by an infiltration of coagulated
lymph in the subcutaneous tissue of the
neck, abdomen and extremities giving a swollen
appearance thereto. The natural reservoirs in
which <i>T. brucei</i> has been long acclimatized are
unaffected by the trypanosomes, while the newer
hosts, such as imported cattle in Africa, are
rapidly destroyed by their action.</p>

<p>The general morphology and life history in
the vertebrate host is that of a typical trypanosome
(fig.&nbsp;40). Its length is from 12&nbsp;Âµ to 35&nbsp;Âµ,
its breadth from 1Â·5&nbsp;Âµ to 4&nbsp;Âµ. Multiplication by
longitudinal division proceeds in the peripheral
blood (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_26">26</a>), while latent, leishmaniform
bodies are produced in the internal organs.</p>

<p>Bruce and colleagues<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> have quite recently
(June, 1914) described the development of a
Zululand strain of <i>T. brucei</i> in <i>G. morsitans</i>. The tsetse flies were
bred out in Nyasaland. In vertebrate blood the <i>brucei</i> strain
was polymorphic. The development was like that found for
<i>T. gambiense</i> in <i>G. palpalis</i> (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_30">30</a>), and by Bruce and colleagues for
<i>T. rhodesiense</i> in <i>G. morsitans</i> in Nyasaland. Long trypanosomes
were found in the proventriculus of the tsetse. Crithidial, rounded
or encysted, and immature âblood formsâ occurred in the salivary
glands; and finally infective, stumpy, âblood formsâ were differentiated
in the salivary glands. The period of development of <i>T. brucei</i>
in <i>G. morsitans</i> takes about three weeks, and then the fly becomes
infective. Bruce believes that <i>T. rhodesiense</i> of Nyasaland and
<i>T. brucei</i> of Zululand are the same, their cycles of development
in <i>G. morsitans</i> being âmarvellously alike.â (But see Laveran, p.&nbsp;80.)</p>

<p><i>T. brucei</i> has been cultivated with difficulty by Novy and MacNeal,
using blood agar. The best treatment for nagana is arsenic in some form.</p>

<p>It is probable that more than one trypanosome has been confused
under the name <i>T. brucei</i>, more especially as the occurrence of
many species of trypanosomes in various animals in Africa was not<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>
suspected until comparatively recent times. It has been shown by
Stephens and Blacklock (1913) that the original Zululand strain of
<i>T. brucei</i> was monomorphic, while the organism sent from Uganda,
and at the time believed by Bruce to be the same as the Zululand
trypanosome, has been found to be polymorphic, with morphological
resemblances to <i>T. rhodesiense</i>. Stephens and Blacklock<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> have
suggested the name <i>T. ugandÃ¦</i> for the polymorphic trypanosome,
which, however, has marked resemblances with <b>Trypanosoma
pecaudi</b>, and they are, perhaps, identical. <i>T. pecaudi</i> was the name
given by Laveran<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> in 1907 to the causal agent of âbaleriâ in equines
and sheep in the French Sudan. <i>T. pecaudi</i>, which is dimorphic,
is widely distributed in Africa. An extremely small number of both
<i>T. pecaudi</i> and <i>T. ugandÃ¦</i> have been shown to possess posterior
nuclei. <i>T. pecaudi</i> is transmitted by various species of <i>Glossina</i>,
and is said to develop in the gut and proboscis of the fly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Bruce and colleagues (1914), examining a
strain sent from Zululand in 1913, state that <i>T. brucei</i> is polymorphic.
Bruce (1914) suggests that passage through laboratory hosts has
influenced and altered the morphology of the parasite.</p>

<p><i>Trypanosoma evansi</i>, first found by Evans in 1880, in India, is the
causal agent of the disease known as âsurra.â The malady affects
more particularly horses, mules, camels and cattle in India and neighbouring
countries, such as Burma and Indo-China. It occurs also in
Java, the Philippines, Mauritius and North Africa. Elephants may
be affected. A serious outbreak among cattle in Mauritius occurred
in 1902, the disease being imported into the island. The symptoms
are fever, emaciation, Ådema, great muscular weakness and paralysis
culminating in death.</p>

<p><i>T. evansi</i> varies from 18&nbsp;Âµ to 34&nbsp;Âµ in length and 1Â·5&nbsp;Âµ to 2&nbsp;Âµ in
breadth. It has a pointed posterior extremity, and, anteriorly, there
is a free portion to the flagellum (fig.&nbsp;41). It is possibly monomorphic,
but a few broad forms occur. The trypanosome multiplies
by longitudinal fission in the blood. Rounded leishmaniform stages
occur in the spleen of the vertebrate host, which stages Walker<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> (1912)
considers to be phases of schizogony.</p>

<p>A variety of <i>T. evansi</i> is the cause of âmboriâ in dromedaries
in Africa (Sahara and Sudan). Another possible variety, or closely
allied form, is <i>T. soudanense</i>, the causal agent
of âel debabâ in camels and horses in North
Africa, especially Algeria and Egypt.</p>

<p>An extraordinary example of the possible
infection of a human being with an animal
trypanosome is recorded in the case of Professor
Lanfranchi, of the Veterinary School,
Parma. The Professor became infected with
trypanosomes, although only nagana and surra
were maintained in his laboratory, and he
himself had never visited the tropics. He
suffered from irregular attacks of fever and
was Ådematous, but his mind remained clear.
The identification of the trypanosome from
Lanfranchiâs blood has been a matter of great
difficulty. Apparently Mesnil and Blanchard
(1914)<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> consider the strain found in the patient is almost indistinguishable
in its reactions from <i>T. gambiense</i>, though the parasite is monomorphic.
Lanfranchi considers that he was infected with <i>T. evansi</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trypanosoma equinum</i> was found by Elmassian to be the cause of
the fatal disease, âmal de caderas,â of horses
and dogs, in South America (Paraguay, Argentine,
Bolivia). The name refers to the fact that
in the disease, as in other trypanosomiases,
the hind quarters become paralysed. Cattle
are refractory to inoculation.</p>

<p><i>T. equinum</i> is about 22&nbsp;Âµ to 24&nbsp;Âµ long
and about 1Â·5&nbsp;Âµ broad (fig.&nbsp;42). Although this
trypanosome is very active, yet it is characterized
by the blepharoplast (kinetic nucleus)
being very minute or even absent, as the
granule sometimes seen may be the basal
granule of the flagellum.</p>

<p>The mode of transmission of <i>T. equinum</i>
is not known with absolute certainty. Migone
has shown that the parasite causes a fatal disease in the large South<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
American rodent, the capybara (<i>HydrochÅrus capybara</i>). This animal
appears to be a reservoir of the parasite. Dogs may become infected
by eating diseased capybaras, and it is suggested that the infection is
spread from the dogs to horses by the agency of fleas. Some authorities
consider that <i>T. equinum</i> may be spread by various <i>TabanidÃ¦</i> and by
<i>Stomoxys</i>. Neiva (1913)<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> doubts all these modes of transmission in

</div>

<p>The progress of the disease may be considered
under three periods. The <i>period of
Ådema</i>, when signs of Ådema of the genitalia
are seen. The Ådema is generally painless
and non-inflammatory. This period lasts about
a month. It is succeeded by the <i>period of
eruption</i>, which sets in about two months
after infection. Circular Ådematous areas
(âplaquesâ), often about the size of a two-shilling
piece, appear under the skin of the sides
and hind quarters, and also, at times, under the
skin of the neck, thighs and shoulders. The
eruption is variable, but usually lasts about a week and leaves the
animal in an enfeebled condition. Gland enlargement and swelling
of the joints and synovia also may occur. The third period of the
disease is described as that <i>of anÃ¦mia and paralysis</i>. The animal
becomes very anÃ¦mic, emaciation is marked, superficial non-healing
abscesses often form, and conjunctivitis and ulcerative keratitis can
occur. Paralysis ensues, and in from two to eighteen months the
animal dies. In the acute form of the disease the animal may die
after the first period from acute paralysis.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find the trypanosomes in naturally infected
animals, and they are best obtained from the plaques of the
eruption. Apparently the parasite occurs more in the lymph than
in the blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span></p>

show chromatic granules (fig.&nbsp;43). It is stated to be monomorphic.</p>

there is another trypanosome giving rise to dourine in horses. This

<p>A number of trypanosomes, characterized by relative uniformity
in size and structure, may be considered under this heading. They
occur in cattle, sheep, goats and horses in Africa, especially West
Africa. Morphologically, they are characterized by the posterior
(aflagellar) part of the body being swollen, while the anterior part
narrows. The nucleus is central and situated at the commencement
of the narrowing of the body. The blepharoplast is almost
terminal, the undulating membrane is narrow and not markedly
folded, so that the flagellar border lies close to or along the body.
The flagellum may or may not possess a free portion.</p>

<p>This trypanosome causes disease among
horses (<i>e.g.</i>, Gambia horse sickness), cattle,
sheep, goats, pigs, and dogs. It is widely distributed
in Central Africa (<i>e.g.</i>, Gambia, Congo,
Uganda, Nyasaland), the strain probably being
maintained naturally in big game. It is transmitted
by various <i>GlossinÃ¦</i>, and perhaps by <i>Tabanus</i> and <i>Stomoxys</i>. It
is said to develop in the gut and proboscis of <i>Glossina palpalis</i> and
<i>G. morsitans</i>. The trypanosome averages 13&nbsp;Âµ to 14&nbsp;Âµ in length and
has no free flagellum (fig.&nbsp;46). It is about 2&nbsp;Âµ broad. Formerly
<i>T. nanum</i> and <i>T. pecorum</i> were said to differ in their pathogenicity, the
former being said not to infect the smaller laboratory animals. Yorke
and Blacklock (1913), however, consider
that the virulence varies and that these
trypanosomes are probably the same.</p>

<p>This trypanosome was found in oxen in Uganda.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> It can be inoculated
to oxen, goats and sheep, but is refractory to dogs, rats and

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">General Note on Development of
Trypanosomes in Glossina.</span></p>

<p>Before concluding the account of trypanosomes,
it may be of interest to remark that
several African trypanosomes develop in various species of <i>Glossina</i>,
and are found in different parts of the alimentary tract and in the
proboscis. Thus (<i>a</i>) <i>T. vivax</i>, <i>T. uniforme</i> and <i>T. caprÃ¦</i> develop in the
flyâs proboscis (labial cavity and hypopharynx) only; (<i>b</i>) <i>T. congolense</i>,
<i>T. simiÃ¦</i> and <i>T. pecaudi</i> develop first in the gut of the fly and then
pass forward to its proboscis; and (<i>c</i>) <i>T. gambiense</i> and <i>T. rhodesiense</i>
develop first in the gut and later invade the salivary glands of the
tsetse. The proboscis or the salivary glands in such cases are termed
by Duke<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> the <i>anterior station</i> of the trypanosome, wherein it completes
its development.</p>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Adaptation of Trypanosomes.</span></p>

<p>These flagellates may exhibit power of adaptation to changes of
environment, such as those due to the administration of drugs, change
of host, etc. A few examples of such mutations may be briefly
<span class="nowrap">considered:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) <i>Blepharoplastless Trypanosomes</i>.&mdash;<i>T. brucei</i> may become resistant
to pyronin and oxazine. Accompanying this drug resistance is a
change in morphology, namely, the loss of the blepharoplast
(Werbitzki).<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> A race or strain of blepharoplastless trypanosomes may
be thus produced which retains its characteristic feature after as many
as 130 passages (Laveran).<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> Oxazine is the more powerful drug, and
it acts directly on the blepharoplast. (Compare the natural blepharoplastless
character of <i>T. equinum</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span></p>

<p>(2) Reference has been made on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_93">93</a> to the experiments of
Gonder, who showed that a strain of <i>T. lewisi</i> rendered resistant to
arsenophenylglycin lost its resistance after passage through the rat
louse. This is in marked contrast with the retention of drug resistance
during passage by inoculation from rat to rat.</p>

<p>(3) <i>T. lewisi</i> from the blood of a rat when transferred to a snake
seems largely to disappear, as very few flagellates are seen. When
blood from the snake is inoculated into a clean rat, then trypanosomes
reappear in the rat, but they are not all like those originally
inoculated. It seems certain that, in such a case, changes in form
and virulence of the trypanosome have occurred. Similar experiments
were made with <i>T. brucei</i> from rats to adders and other animals and
back to rats. Changes in the form and virulence of <i>T. brucei</i> occurred.</p>

<p>These interesting experiments were performed by Wendelstadt and
Fellmer.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>


<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Herpetomonas</b>, Saville Kent, 1881.</p>

<p><i>Herpetomonas</i> is a generic name for certain flagellates possessing
a vermiform or snake-like body, a nucleus placed approximately centrally,
and a blepharoplast (kinetic nucleus) near the flagellar end.
There is no undulating membrane (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_49">49</a>, <i>a</i>). The organisms included
in this genus certainly possess one flagellum, while according
to Prowazek (1904) <i>Herpetomonas muscÃ¦-domesticÃ¦</i>, the type species,
possesses two flagella united by a membrane. Patton,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> Porter<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> and
others affirm, however, that the biflagellate character of <i>H. muscÃ¦-domesticÃ¦</i>
(from the gut of the house-fly) is merely due to precocious
division. The matter is further complicated by the generic name
<i>Leptomonas</i>, given by Kent in 1881, to an uniflagellate organism found
by BÃ¼tschli in the intestine of the Nematode worm, <i>Trilobus gracilis</i>.
This parasite, <i>Leptomonas bÃ¼tschlii</i>, has not yet been completely
studied. Until these controversial points relating to the identity or
separation of <i>Herpetomonas</i> and <i>Leptomonas</i> have been satisfactorily
settled, we may retain the better known name <i>Herpetomonas</i> for such
uniflagellate, vermiform organisms. However, the name <i>Leptomonas</i>,
having been used by Kent two pages earlier in his book (âManual of
the Infusoriaâ) than <i>Herpetomonas</i>, would have priority if the two
generic names were ultimately shown to be synonymous.</p>

<p>A full discussion of these interesting and important flagellates
hardly comes within the purview of the present work; brief mention
can only be given here to certain species.</p>

<p>The Herpetomonads occur principally in the digestive tracts of
insects, such as Diptera and Hemiptera. They are also known in the<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
guts of fleas and lice, but are not confined to blood-sucking insects.
One example, <i>H. ctenocephali</i> (Fantham, 1912)<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> occurs in the digestive
tracts of dog fleas, <i>Ctenocephalus canis</i>, in England, France, Germany,
Italy, India, Tunis, etc. It is a natural flagellate of the flea, and might
easily be confused with stages of blood parasites in the gut of the dog
flea. Dog fleas are stated by Basile to transmit canine kala-azar, which
is believed to be the same as human infantile kala-azar. Confusion is
further likely to arise since herpetomonads pass through pre-flagellate,
flagellate and post-flagellate or encysted stages; pre- and post-flagellate
stages being oval or rounded and <i>Leishmania</i>-like. The post-flagellate
stages are shed in the fÃ¦ces, and are the cross-infective stages by
means of which new hosts are infected by the mouth. The possible
presence of such natural flagellates must always be considered when
experimenting with fleas,
lice, mosquitoes, etc., as
possible vectors of pathogenic
flagellates like <i>Leishmania</i>
and <i>Trypanosoma</i>.
<i>H. pediculi</i> (Fantham,
1912) occurs in human
body lice.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> See further

<p>Laveran and Franchini
(1913â14)<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> have recently
succeeded in inoculating
<i>Herpetomonas ctenocephali</i>,
from the gut of the dog
flea, intraperitoneally into
white mice, and producing
an experimental leishmaniasis
in the mice. A
dog was also infected. They have also succeeded in infecting mice
with <i>H. pattoni</i>&mdash;a natural flagellate of the rat flea&mdash;by mixing infected
rat fleas with the food of the mice, and by causing them to
ingest infected fÃ¦ces of rat fleas. Further, they have shown that
infection with the herpetomonas occurs naturally by this method,
that is, by the rodents eating the fleas and not by the insects inoculating
the flagellates into the vertebrates when sucking blood. These
experiments shed an interesting light on the probable origin of
<i>Leishmania</i> and its cultural herpetomonad stage, which were very
probably once parasitic flagellates in the gut of an insect.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span></p>
<p>Fantham and Porter<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> (1914â15) have shown that young mice may
be inoculated or fed with <i>Herpetomonas jaculum</i>, from the gut of the
Hemipteran, <i>Nepa cinerea</i> (the so-called âwater-scorpionâ), with fatal
results. The pathogenic effects are like those of kala-azar. They also
showed that the post-flagellate stages of the herpetomonads seemed
most capable of developing in the vertebrate.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A herpetomonad, <i>H. davidi</i>, has been found in the latex of species of the plant-genus
<i>Euphorbia</i> in Mauritius, India, Portugal, etc. It is apparently transmitted to
the plants by <i>Hemiptera</i>. The plants sometimes suffer from âflagellosis.â</p></div>

<p>Franchini (1913)<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> has described a new parasite, <i>HÃ¦mocystozoon
brasiliense</i>, from the blood of a man who had lived in Brazil for many
years. It possesses flagellate and rounded stages, and is closely allied
to the herpetomonads.</p>


<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Crithidia</b>, LÃ©ger, 1902, emend. Patton, 1908.</p>

<p><i>Crithidia</i> is the generic name of vermiform flagellates with a
central nucleus, a blepharoplast or kinetic nucleus in the neighbourhood
of the principal nucleus, and a rudimentary undulating membrane
bordered by a flagellum arising from a basal granule, which is the
centrosome of the kinetic nucleus (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_49">49</a><i>b</i>). The anterior or flagellar
end of the body is attenuated and fades off as the undulating membrane.</p>

<p><i>Crithidia fasciculata</i>, the type species, was found by LÃ©ger in the
alimentary canal of <i>Anopheles maculipennis</i>. Crithidia occur in bugs,
flies, fleas,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> and ticks. Some of them are found in the body-fluid
of the invertebrate host as well as in the gut. Others may be restricted
to the body cavity or intestine respectively. <i>C. melophagia</i> from the
sheep-ked, <i>Melophagus ovinus</i>, and <i>C. hyalommÃ¦</i> from the hÃ¦mocÅlic
fluid of the tick, <i>Hyalomma Ã¦gyptium</i>, pass into the ovaries and eggs
of their hosts, and the young keds or ticks are born infected.</p>

<p><i>C. fasciculata</i> has been shown by Laveran and Franchini to be
inoculable into white mice, producing a sort of experimental leishmaniasis
therein. In one case cutaneous lesions were produced like
those of Oriental sore.</p>

<p>Crithidia are natural flagellates of Arthropoda, with their own
pre-flagellate, flagellate and post-flagellate stages, and must not be
confused with transitory crithidial stages of trypanosomes.</p>


<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Leishmania</b>, Ross, 1903.</p>

<p>With an oval body containing nucleus and blepharoplast (kinetic nucleus)

<p><span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span></p>

<p class="ml2hi5">(1) <i>Leishmania donovani</i>, Laveran and Mesnil, 1903, the parasite
of Indian kala-azar, a generalized systemic disease, usually
fatal, occurring in subjects of all ages.</p>

<p class="ml2hi5">(2) <i>Leishmania tropica</i>, Wright, 1903, the parasite of Delhi boil,
Oriental sore, Aleppo button&mdash;a localized, cutaneous disease,
usually benign.</p>

<p class="ml2hi5">(3) <i>Leishmania infantum</i>, Nicolle, 1908, the parasite of infantile
kala-azar, occurring in children (and a few adults) around
the shores of the Mediterranean. The disease is perhaps a
form of Indian kala-azar, and the parasite is probably identical
with <i>L. donovani</i>.</p>

<p>These diseases may be termed collectively leishmaniases. The
morphology of the various species is practically identical.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Leishmania donovani</b>, Laveran and Mesnil, 1903.</p>

<p class="syn">Syn.: <i>Piroplasma donovani</i>, Laveran and Mesnil.</p>

<p>The parasite of Indian kala-azar was demonstrated in 1900 by
Leishman from a <i>post-mortem</i> examination of a case of âDum-Dum
fever,â but details were not published till May, 1903. In July, 1903,
Donovan found similar bodies from cases in Madras. Rogers
succeeded in cultivating the parasite in July, 1904.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> The original
centre of the disease was probably Assam; it occurs also in Madras,
Ceylon, Burma, Indo-China, China and Syria. A variety of this leishmaniasis
is found in the Sudan. The patient becomes emaciated,
with a greatly enlarged spleen. There is anÃ¦mia and leucopenia.</p>

<p>The parasite, commonly known as the Leishman-Donovan body,
is intracellular (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_50">50</a>, 2, 3). It is found in the endothelial cells of the
capillaries of the liver, spleen, bone-marrow, lymphatic glands and
intestinal mucosa, and in the macrophages of the spleen and bone-marrow.
Some host cells may contain many parasites. It is rather
rare in the circulating blood, but may be found in the blood from
the femoral, portal and hepatic veins. It does not occur in the red
blood corpuscles as was formerly thought. The parasites liberated
from the endothelial cells are taken up by the mononuclear and
polymorphonuclear leucocytes. The Leishman-Donovan body is the
resting stage of a flagellate. As found in man it is a small, oval
organism, about 2Â·5&nbsp;Âµ to 3Â·5&nbsp;Âµ in length by 2&nbsp;Âµ in breadth, and containing
two chromatinic bodies, corresponding to the nucleus and
kinetic nucleus (blepharoplast) of a flagellate. The latter element is
the smaller and more deeply staining, and is usually placed at the
periphery, transversely to the longer axis of the oval organism.<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
There is sometimes a very short, slightly curved filament to be seen,
which may be a rhizoplast. Multiplication takes place by binary or
multiple fission. The presence of the parasite used to be demonstrated
by splenic or hepatic puncture; nowadays it can be demonstrated in
peripheral blood, <i>e.g.</i>, of the finger, or by culture of infected blood.</p>

</div>

<p><i>L. donovani</i> can be cultivated in citrated splenic blood, under
aerobic conditions, at 22Â° to 25Â°&nbsp;C. This was first accomplished
by Rogers (1904). It is not so easily culturable as <i>L. infantum</i> on
the Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle medium.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> <i>L. donovani</i> is inoculable with<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
some difficulty into experimental animals&mdash;in India, white rats, white
mice, dogs and monkeys (<i>Macacus spp.</i>), have been inoculated. The
Sudan variety, somewhat less virulent, is inoculable to monkeys. Row
also produced a local lesion in <i>Macacus sinicus</i> by subcutaneous inoculation
of <i>L. donovani</i>. Parasites taken from such a local lesion were
found to be capable of producing a generalised infection in <i>Macacus
sinicus</i> and white mice.</p>

<p>In cultures the various species of <i>Leishmania</i> all grow into
herpetomonad, uniflagellate organisms (fig.&nbsp;50, 10), about 12&nbsp;Âµ to 20&nbsp;Âµ
in body length. On this account Rogers<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> and Patton place the
Leishman-Donovan body within the genus <i>Herpetomonas</i>. The
method of culture may be used in diagnosing leishmaniases.</p>

<p>Kala-azar is very probably an insect-borne disease. Patton<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> suspects
the bed-bug to be the transmitter and finds (fig.&nbsp;50, <i>4</i>-<i>6</i>) that the
Leishman-Donovan body can develop into the flagellate stage in the
digestive tract of the bed-bug. Feeding experiments are unsatisfactory,
since there are very few cases in which the parasites occur in sufficient
numbers in the peripheral blood to make the infection of the insect
possible, or at any rate easy. In examining the alimentary tracts of
insects for possible flagellate stages of <i>Leishmania</i>, it must be remembered
that in many insects natural flagellate parasites, belonging to the
genus <i>Herpetomonas</i>, may occur therein; such natural insect flagellates
may be harmless, and have no connection with the life-cycle of
<i>L. donovani</i>. Natural herpetomonads are known to occur in the
alimentary tracts of flies, mosquitoes, sand-flies, fleas and lice, but
not in bed-bugs. Further, if such flagellates are able to be inoculated
into and live within vertebrate hosts, producing symptoms like those
of leishmaniasis, the origin of kala-azar is indicated (see pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_104">104</a>, <a href="#Page_112">112</a>).</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Leishmania tropica</b>, Wright, 1903.</p>

<p class="syn">Syn.: <i>Helcosoma tropicum</i>, Wright, 1903; <i>L. wrighti</i>, Nicolle, 1908; <i>Ovoplasma
orientale</i>, Marzinowsky and Bogrow.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is believed by some that the parasite was first described by Cunningham in
1885, and studied by Firth in 1891, being called by him <i>Sporozoon furunculosum</i>.
If these earlier studies were of the parasite, then its correct name is <i>L. furunculosa</i>,
Firth, 1891.</p></div>

<p>The benign disease produced by this parasite has received many
names, among the best known being Oriental sore, Tropical sore,
Delhi boil and Aleppo button. These names, however, are not happy
ones, as cutaneous leishmaniasis (<i>e.g.</i>, on the ear) is now known to
occur in the New World, for example in Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil
and neighbouring States. However, it may be necessary to subdivide
cutaneous leishmaniases later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span></p>

<p>In the Old World the disease occurs in India, Persia, Arabia and
Transcaucasia. It is also known in Algeria, Northern Nigeria, Egypt,
Sudan, Crete, Calabria, Sicily and Greece.</p>

<p>The boils often occur on the face, and before ulceration the
parasites may be found in the cells at the margin and floor of the
âbutton.â In searching for parasites the scab should be removed and
scrapings made from the floor and edges. Where lesions occur
atrophy of the epidermis takes place, and infiltration of mononuclear
cells (<i>e.g.</i>, plasma cells, lymphoid and endothelial cells) follows.
The parasites are intracellular, being found inside mononuclear cells.
In non-ulcerating sores, Cardamitis found some free parasites. Non-ulcerating
forms are said to occur in the Sudan. In the Old World
the sores are often limited to exposed surfaces of the body. Infection
of mucous membranes (such as the lip, palate, buccal and nasal
membranes) may occur, especially in South America, and are often
known there as âEspundia.â Christopherson (1914) has recorded a
case in Khartoum.</p>

<p><i>Leishmania tropica</i> is equally well cultivated on Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle
medium or on citrated blood. The usual temperature for
cultivation is 22Â° to 28Â°&nbsp;C., though Marzinowski claims to have
cultivated the parasite at 37Â°&nbsp;C. <i>L. tropica</i> can be inoculated
into monkeys and dogs, with the production of local lesions.
Material from a human sore or flagellates from a culture may be thus
successfully inoculated. Also infected material may be rubbed
directly into a scarified surface. The incubation period is long,
extending over several months. The duration of the disease may be
from twelve to eighteen months. Recovery from one attack of tropical
sore confers immunity, and the Jews in Bagdad inoculate their children
with the disease on a part of the body which will be covered, and
so secure immunity in adult life.</p>

<p>The mode of transmission of <i>L. tropica</i> is unknown. Wenyon
(1911)<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> has found that the parasite develops into the flagellate stage
in the digestive tract of <i>Stegomyia fasciata</i> in Bagdad. Patton (1912)<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>
has found similar development in the bed-bug in Cambay. The
house-fly, <i>Phlebotomus</i> and <i>Simulium</i> have been suspected as transmitters
in different parts of the world.</p>

<p>An interesting announcement has been made recently (May, 1913),
that Neligan has found that <i>L. tropica</i> occurs in dogs in Teheran,
Persia, producing ulcers on the dogsâ faces (<i>cf.</i> natural occurrence of
<i>L. infantum</i> in dogs&mdash;see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_110">110</a>). Yakimoff and Schokhor (1914),<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
have found the disease in dogs in Tashkent.</p>

<p>Gonder<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> (1913) has performed some interesting experiments<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
showing the relation of infantile kala-azar to Oriental sore. Gonder
infected mice with <i>L. infantum</i> and with <i>L. tropica</i>. He used culture
material and injected intraperitoneally or intravenously. In each a
general infection resulted, with enlargement of the liver and spleen.
Later, however, mice injected with Oriental sore (North African
variety) developed peripheral lesions on the feet, tail and head, and
the lesions contained <i>Leishmania</i>. No such peripheral lesions
developed in the case of the mice infected with the kala-azar virus.
Gonder suggested that Oriental sore, like kala-azar, is really a general
infection overlooked in its earlier stages, and that it is in the later
stages that peripheral lesions on the skin are developed. Row (1914)<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>
also obtained a general infection in a mouse by the injection of
cultures of <i>L. tropica</i> from Oriental sore of Cambay.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Leishmania infantum</b>, Nicolle, 1908.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>Infantile splenic anÃ¦mia has been long known in Italy. It also
occurs in Algeria, Tunis, Tripoli, Syria, Greece, Turkey, Crete, Sicily,
Malta,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> Spain and Portugal. This leishmaniasis is, then, distributed along
the Mediterranean littoral; also in Russia. Cathoire (1904) in Tunis
and Pianese (1905) in Italy were among the first to see the parasite.
Nicolle then found the parasite in patients in Tunis, and further found
spontaneous infection in dogs. The patients are usually children
between the ages of 2 and 5 years. There are a few cases known in
which the infantile type of leishmaniasis occurred in youths and adults
of the ages of 17 to 19, while one patient in Calabria was 38 years old.
The symptoms are like those of Indian kala-azar. Several Italian
investigators and others consider that <i>L. infantum</i> is the same as
<i>L. donovani</i>, and that the latter name should be used for the parasite
of Mediterranean leishmaniasis. This view, as to the identity of
<i>L. donovani</i> and <i>L. infantum</i>, seems coming into general favour.</p>

<p>There are, however, differences between the Indian and infantile
kala-azars, in addition to the ages of the patients affected, thus:
(<i>a</i>) As regards cultures, it is found that <i>L. infantum</i> is readily grown
on the Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle (âN.N.N.â) medium (saline blood-agar),
and that sub-cultures are easily obtained; in citrated blood
<i>L. infantum</i> grows with difficulty. The reverse is the case with
regard to culture media for <i>L. donovani</i>, which grows with difficulty
on the N.N.N. medium, but relatively easily in citrated splenic blood.
(<i>b</i>) Considering inoculability into experimental animals, it is found that
<i>L. donovani</i> is inoculated generally with some difficulty into white rats,<span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
white mice and monkeys, and with greater difficulty into dogs, while
<i>L. infantum</i> can be inoculated into several experimental animals,
especially into dogs and monkeys, with ease. (<i>c</i>) At present <i>L. donovani</i>
is not known to occur spontaneously in animals, but <i>L. infantum</i> is
found naturally in dogs in the Mediterranean region, and the disease in
dogs is often referred to as canine kala-azar. Kittens have occasionally
been found infected. However, these differences must not be emphasized
too much.</p>

<p>The material for cultivation is obtained from punctures of spleen,
liver or bone-marrow of cases infected with <i>L. infantum</i>. It is not
always easy, however, to infect from cultures, as the cultural flagellates
inoculated into the body are often phagocytosed.</p>

<p>Similarly, the material for animal inoculation is obtained from
emulsions of infected spleen, liver or bone-marrow. Dogs and
monkeys are easily inoculated with such material; Nicolle inoculates
into the liver or the peritoneal cavity. Mice, white rats, guinea-pigs
and rabbits only show slight infections after such inoculations.</p>

<p>Dogs infected experimentally with infantile leishmaniasis may
show either acute or chronic symptoms. The acute course occurs
more often in young dogs, and is usually fatal in three to five months.
The chronic course is found more commonly in older dogs, and may
last seventeen to eighteen months. In acute forms there is irregular
fever, progressive wasting, diarrhÅa occasionally, motor disturbances
involving the hind quarters, and the animal dies in a comatose condition.
In the chronic form the animal may appear well, except for
loss of weight. The parasites may be found in the internal organs of
these experimental dogs, but are not numerous in the peripheral
blood except at times of high fever. Experimental monkeys live about
three months.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to record the number of dogs found to be
infected naturally with leishmaniasis in various countries. In Tunis,
Nicolle and Yakimoff found about 2 per cent. infected out of about
500 dogs examined. Sergent in Algiers found 9 infected out of 125
dogs examined. In Italy and Sicily, Basile found about 40 per cent.
of the dogs to be infected out of 93 examined at Rome and
Bordonaro. Cardamitis found 15 infected out of 184 examined in
Athens. In Malta, Critien found 3 infected out of 30 dogs examined.
Alvares found 1 infected dog out of 19 examined in Lisbon. Pringault
has recently (December, 1913) found an infected dog in Marseilles.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
Yakimoff and Schokhor found 24 per cent. infected out of 647 dogs
examined in Turkestan.</p>

<p>The distribution of the parasites in the body of the human patient
is much the same as in the case of Indian kala-azar. Critien records<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>
the finding of parasites in the mucous flakes of the stools of a three-year-old
Maltese child.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> Intestinal lesions rarely occur in infantile
leishmaniasis.</p>

<p><i>Ãtiology.</i>&mdash;Infantile leishmaniasis is stated to be transmitted by
fleas, especially dog fleas, <i>Ctenocephalus canis</i> (= <i>Pulex serraticeps</i>), and
by <i>Pulex irritans</i>. Children living in contact with infected dogs may be
bitten by infected dog fleas, and so contract the disease. Basile (1910â11)
and Sangiorgi (1910) state that they found <i>L. infantum</i> parasites in the
digestive tract of the dog flea. After searching they found infected
dog fleas on the beds, mattresses, and pillows used by children
suffering from the disease. Franchini (1912) thinks that <i>Anopheles
maculipennis</i> may be concerned in the transmission.</p>

<p>Basile<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> tried a number of experiments to show that infantile
leishmaniasis is transmitted by fleas, <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) Fleas were taken from a healthy dog. They were placed in
vessels containing infected spleen-pulp and allowed to feed thereon.
The fleas were then killed and dissected, and portions of the gut-contents
examined for parasites. The remainder of the gut was
emulsified and injected into a young puppy, whose bone-marrow had
been shown previously to be uninfected. Basile states that the puppy
became infected. The parasites are said to increase in number in
the fleaâs gut.</p>

<p>(2) Two healthy pups, each a month old, and born in the laboratory,
were placed in a disinfected, flea-proof cage. A few days after,
an infected dog was placed in the cage, so that fleas from the
infected dog could pass on to the puppies. A month later the two
pups became infected, parasites being found in them after liver
puncture. A number of control puppies from the same litter
remained uninfected and in good health.</p>

<p>(3) Basile next used other laboratory-born puppies, a month old.
Four of the litter were placed in a disinfected, flea-proof gauze cage
in Rome. The cage was isolated from other dogs. Fleas obtained
from an infected area in Sicily were placed in the cage. The puppies
were examined by hepatic puncture, but were found to be negative
for two months. Then two of the puppies showed infection, and
six days later the remaining two puppies were found to be infected,
and all four died. They showed irregular temperatures, and were
getting thin. Control puppies remained healthy.</p>

<p>From these experiments Basile concludes that fleas transmit
leishmaniasis. However, Basile did not exclude the possible occurrence
of natural herpetomonads in the gut of the fleas.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> <i>Herpetomonas<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
ctenocephali</i> is known to occur in the gut of <i>Ctenocephalus canis</i>.
A natural <i>Herpetomonas</i> is also known in the gut of <i>Pulex irritans</i>,
as well as a <i>Crithidia</i> (<i>C. pulicis</i>, Porter). These natural flagellates of
the fleas pass through non-flagellate stages, like the Leishman-Donovan
body. In consequence Wenyon and Patton, among others, have
criticized Basileâs results. Further, other investigators, such as
Wenyon and Da Silva (1913), have repeated Basileâs flea experiments
and been unable to confirm them.</p>

<p>In feeding and inoculation experiments the incubation period of
the parasite may be long, and so it is necessary to wait a long time to
see whether the parasite will develop.</p>

<p><i>Immunity.</i>&mdash;Nicolle has tried some experiments with <i>L. infantum</i>
and <i>L. tropica</i>. He finds that in animals recovery from an attack of the
former confers immunity against infection by the latter and vice-versÃ¢.</p>

<p>Laveran<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> records that a monkey having an immunity against <i>L.
infantum</i> was also immune to <i>L. donovani</i>.</p>

<p>As mentioned on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_103">103</a>, Laveran and Franchini (1913), working in
Paris, have succeeded in inoculating <i>Herpetomonas ctenocephali</i>, a
natural flagellate in the gut of the flea, <i>Ctenocephalus canis</i>, into
white mice. Leishmaniform stages of the flea flagellate were recovered
from the peritoneal exudate, blood and organs of the mice
some weeks after inoculation. The parasites may also be conveyed by
way of the digestive tract of the vertebrate. Similar experiments have
succeeded with <i>H. pattoni</i>. These experiments go to show, together
with those of Fantham and Porter with <i>H. jaculum</i> (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_104">104</a>), that, in
the words of the latter authors, âit may be expected that the various
leishmaniases, occurring in different parts of the world, will prove to
be insect-borne herpetomoniases.â</p>

<p>Under the name <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> Darling described small
round or oval parasites, enclosed in a refractile capsule, and each containing
a single nucleus. The bodies were found in cases of splenomegaly
in Panama. They occurred in the endothelial cells of the
small blood-vessels of the liver, spleen, lungs, intestine and lymphatic
glands, and also within the leucocytes. A few flagellates were stated to
occur in the lungs. The parasite has usually been placed near <i>Leishmania</i>,
but recently Rocha-Lima has stated that <i>Histoplasma</i> is a yeast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span></p>

<h5>THE SPIROCHÃTES.</h5>

<p>The SpirochÃ¦tes are long, narrow, wavy, thread-like organisms,
with a firm yet flexible outer covering or periplast. There is a diffuse
nucleus internally in the form of bars or rodlets of chromatin
distributed along the body. In some forms there is a membrane or
crista present (fig.&nbsp;53), which in the past was compared with the
undulating membrane of a trypanosome, but the membrane of a
spirochÃ¦te does not undulate. Progression is very rapid, corkscrew-like
and undulatory movements occurring simultaneously.</p>

<p>The genus <i>SpirochÃ¦ta</i> was founded by
Ehrenberg in 1833 for an organism which
he discovered in stagnant water in Berlin.
Ehrenberg named the organism <i>SpirochÃ¦ta
plicatilis</i>. According to Zuelzer (1912) <i>S.
plicatilis</i> does not possess a membrane or
crista, but an axial filament. <i>S. gigantea</i> has
been described by Warming from sea-water.</p>

(After FanÂ­tham and Porter.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>SpirochÃ¦tes occur in the crystalline style
and digestive tract of many bivalve molluscs.
The first molluscan spirochÃ¦te to be studied
was that of the oyster, named by Certes (1882)
â<i>Trypanosoma</i>â <i>balbianii</i> (fig.&nbsp;53). Similar
spirochÃ¦tes, probably belonging to the same
species, occur in various species of <i>Tapes</i> and
in <i>Pecten</i> (the scallop). <i>S. balbianii</i> has rounded
ends (fig.&nbsp;53). Other spirochÃ¦tes occur in freshwater
mussels (<i>Anodonta</i> spp). <i>S. anodontÃ¦</i>,
studied by Keysselitz (1906) and by Fantham
(1907), has pointed ends. Gross (1911) suggested
the generic name <i>Cristispira</i> for molluscan
spirochÃ¦tes, because they possess a
well-marked membrane or âcrista,â which
appears to be absent from <i>S. plicatilis</i>, according
to Zuelzerâs researches.</p>

<p>Schaudinn in 1905 founded the genus
<i>Treponema</i> for the parasite of syphilis (<i>T.
pallidum</i>), discovered by him and by Hoffmann.
According to Schaudinn the Treponemata have no membrane or
crista. The pathogenic agent of yaws or frambÅsia, discovered by
Castellani, is also placed in the genus <i>Treponema</i>, as <i>T. pertenue</i>.</p>

<p>There remain the blood spirochÃ¦tes. It is somewhat disputed as
to whether these organisms possess a membrane. The present writer
considers that they have a slight membrane or crista. The name of<span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>
the genus in which to place the blood-inhabiting forms is somewhat
uncertain and disputed. Various generic names given to them are
<i>SpirochÃ¦ta</i>, <i>Treponema</i>, <i>Spiroschaudinnia</i> (Sambon) and <i>Borrelia</i>
(Swellengrebel). Included in this division are the causal agents of
relapsing or recurrent fever. These Protists will be named, for
description, SpirochÃ¦tes without prejudice as to the ultimate correct
generic name.</p>

<p>It is sometimes made a matter of argument as to whether the
spirochÃ¦tes are Protozoa or Bacteria. Such arguments are somewhat
unprofitable. Morphologically the spirochÃ¦tes are like the Bacteria
in possessing a diffuse nucleus. They differ from <i>Spirillum</i>, an
undoubted bacterial genus, in being flexible and not possessing
flagella. Molluscan spirochÃ¦tes, however, may appear to have
flagella if their membrane becomes frayed or ruptured, when the
myonemes therein (fig.&nbsp;53), becoming separated, form apparent
threads or flagella (Fantham, 1907â08).<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>Again, the mode of division of spirochÃ¦tes has been used as a
criterion of their bacterial or protozoal affinity. They have been
stated to divide transversely, longitudinally, and by âincurvation,â
or bending on themselves in the form of a <b>U</b>, âa form of transverse
fission.â The present writer believes that they divide both transversely
and longitudinally, and that there is a periodicity in their mode of
division at first longitudinal (when there are few spirochÃ¦tes in, say,
the blood) and then transversely (when spirochÃ¦tes are numerous in
the blood).<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> Some authors consider that longitudinal division is explained
by âincurvation.â</p>

<p>The spirochÃ¦tes of relapsing fever show a remarkable periodic
increase and decrease in numbers in the blood. They are transmitted
by ticks or by lice. They react to drugs (<i>e.g.</i>, salvarsan or â606â)
rather like trypanosomes, and&mdash;like Protozoa, but unlike Bacteria&mdash;they
are cultivated with difficulty. These and other criteria have been
used to endeavour to determine whether they are Protozoa or Bacteria.
The present writer believes that they are intermediate in character,
showing morphological affinities with the Bacteria and physiological
and therapeutical affinities with the Protozoa. The group SpirochÃ¦tacea,
as an appendix to the Protozoa, has been created for them
by the present writer (Jan., 1908). Others have placed them in the
SpirochÃ¦toidea of the Bacteria or with the Spirillacea. Doflein (1909)
called them Proflagellata. Further discussion is unnecessary, as they
are undoubtedly Protista (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_29">29</a>).</p>

<p>There is no true conjugation, sex or encystment in spirochÃ¦tes,
but morphological variation may occur.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> They may agglomerate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span></p>
<p>The SpirochÃ¦tes form an interesting chapter in the evolution of
parasites. There are free living forms, parasitic forms in the guts
of both vertebrates and invertebrates, and blood-inhabiting forms.
These probably represent the order of evolution of parasitism. The
blood-inhabiting forms are pathogenic to warm-blooded hosts.</p>

<p>We must now consider the blood SpirochÃ¦tes and the Treponemata
(organisms of syphilis and of yaws).</p>


<p class="ph1">THE SPIROCHÃTES OF THE BLOOD.</p>

<p>There are at least two important human parasites included
<span class="nowrap">hereunder:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>SpirochÃ¦ta recurrentis</i> (=<i>S. obermeieri</i>), (<i>b</i>) <i>SpirochÃ¦ta duttoni</i>.</p>

<p>More is known of the life-cycle of <i>SpirochÃ¦ta duttoni</i>, and it will
be convenient to consider that first.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>SpirochÃ¦ta duttoni</b>, Novy and Knapp, 1906.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The specific name <i>duttoni</i> was also given, independently, to this parasite in 1906
by Breinl and Kinghorn.</p></div>

<p><i>S. duttoni</i> is the pathogenic agent of African tick fever in man,
prevalent in the Congo State and other parts of Africa. The full-grown
organism is about 16&nbsp;Âµ to 24&nbsp;Âµ long, and has pointed ends. It
is 0Â·25&nbsp;Âµ to 0Â·5&nbsp;Âµ broad. P.&nbsp;H. Ross and Nabarro were among the
earliest to see a spirochÃ¦te in the blood of patients in Uganda. It is
transmitted by the tick, <i>Ornithodorus moubata</i>.</p>

<p>In the blood of the patient some of the spirochÃ¦tes may
show, after staining, lighter and darker portions (chromatin dots) and
evidence of the possession of a very narrow membrane (fig.&nbsp;54).
The mode of division has already been discussed. Periodicity in
the direction of division was first described by Fantham and Porter,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>
(1909). Just before the crisis in African tick fever, Breinl has stated
that <i>S. duttoni</i> becomes thinner in the spleen and bone-marrow
and rolls up into skein-like forms, which are surrounded by a thin
âcystâ wall (probably the periplast). Such occur in apyrexial
periods. Inside the cyst the spirochÃ¦te breaks up into granules.
Balfour and Sambon have described somewhat similar rolled up
forms, breaking into granules, inside the red blood cells of Sudanese
fowls in the case of <i>S. granulosa</i> (possibly only a variety of <i>S. gallinarum</i>).
The intracorpuscular stage is not definitely established.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 268px;">
<a id="Fig_54"></a>
<img src="images/i_117.jpg" width="268" height="357" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span>&mdash;<i>SpirochÃ¦ta duttoni</i>. <i>a</i>, blood
form showing slight membrane; <i>b</i>, granules or
coccoid bodies clearly formed within the organism;
<i>c</i>, beginning of extrusion of coccoid bodies in the
tick. (After Fantham.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The granule phase, however, is an essential one in the invertebrate
transmitter (fig.&nbsp;54<i>c</i>). In 1905,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> Dutton and Todd proved experimentally
that <i>O. moubata</i> transmitted <i>S. duttoni</i>. They fed ticks, obtained<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
from Congo native huts in which infected persons lived, on monkeys
and the latter became infected. Dutton and Todd also found the
offspring of infected ticks to be capable of transmitting the infection
to experimental animals. They concluded that <i>O. moubata</i> was a
true intermediate host.</p>

<p>A little later in 1905, Koch stated that spirochÃ¦tes from the gut
of the tick penetrated the gut wall and tissues and found their
way into the eggs in the ovary. Koch figured tangled masses of
spirochÃ¦tes as occurring in the tick eggs. He found ticks infective
to the third generation. He thought that the infection was spread
by the salivary fluid of the tick, in the act of biting. (This is now
known to be incorrect.) Markham Carter (1907) corroborated Kochâs
work on the spirochÃ¦tes in the
tick eggs, and they have been
seen since by Kleine and Eckard
(1913).</p>

<p>Sir William Leishman,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> in
1909â10, found that at ordinary
temperatures the salivary glands
of infected ticks (<i>O. moubata</i>)
were not themselves infective,
and that the infection occurred
by way of the ticksâ excretion.
The spirochÃ¦tes (contained in
the ticksâ excrement) found their
way into the vertebrate host
through the wound made by
biting. While feeding, ticks
pass large quantities of clear
fluid from the coxal glands;
in this fluid an anticoagulin
occurs. Some of the ticks also
pass thick, white Malpighian
secretion, that is, excrement,
towards the end of the feed.
Leishman, using experimental
monkeys, showed that if infected ticks were interrupted while
feeding, then no infection resulted in the monkeys. If, however, the
ticks were allowed to finish their feed, and the Malpighian secretions

<p>Leishmanâs methods and results may be summarized thus:
Saline emulsions of the organs of infected ticks were made, after
the organs had been most carefully dissected out. The ticks were
first kept for several days at certain constant temperatures, such as
24Â° to 25Â°&nbsp;C. or blood heat, 37Â°&nbsp;C. The saline emulsions of the
organs were inoculated, separately, into experimental animals, and the
results <span class="nowrap">recorded:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Coxal fluid is usually negative; thick, white excrement from
Malpighian tubes is positive.</p>

<p>When the ticks were
incubated at 21Â° to 24Â°&nbsp;C.
no spirochÃ¦tes, as such,
were seen in the organs,
except perhaps in the gut,
where they often disappeared
in a few days.
When the ticks were previously
incubated at 35Â° to
37Â°&nbsp;C. for two to three days,
spirochÃ¦tes, as such, reappear
in the gut, organs
and hÃ¦mocÅlic fluid.
The infection proceeds,
not from the salivary gland, but from the infective excrement,
that is, from the thick, white material voided by the tick while
feeding, usually towards the end of the meal. This Malpighian
excrement passes into the wound caused by the bite, being greatly
aided by the clear and more limpid coxa fluid, which bathes the under
surface of the tickâs body, and mixes with and carries the infective
excrement into the wound. Ticks remain infective for a long time.</p>

</div>

<p>The spirochÃ¦tes in the gut of infected ticks divide by a process
of multiple transverse fission into granules, which are composed of
chromatin (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_54">54</a>). These granules&mdash;sometimes known as coccoid
bodies&mdash;are capable of multiplication. Leishman first found them in
clumps inside the cells of the Malpighian tubules (<i>cf.</i> fig.&nbsp;55).</p>

<p>To summarize, when spirochÃ¦tes are ingested by a tick, some of
them pass through the gut-wall into the hÃ¦mocÅlic (body) fluid.
They then bore their way into the cells of various organs (fig.&nbsp;55<i>a</i>)<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
and break up into coccoid bodies. In this manner the granules find
their way into the ovaries and ova, thus explaining how the young
ticks are born infected. Inoculation of these chromatinic granules
usually produces infection. Infective granules are also seen in the
rudiments of the Malpighian tubules of embryo ticks. Bosanquet
and Fantham (1911), independently, have shown that molluscan
spirochÃ¦tes also break up into similar granules or coccoid bodies.
Gross has also demonstrated multiple transverse fission in molluscan
forms. Marchoux and Couvy (1913) and Wolbach (1914) consider
the granules or coccoid bodies to be degeneration products. This is
unlikely (see below).</p>

<p>Schuberg and Manteufel have found that certain <i>O. moubata</i>,
perhaps 30 per cent. of the specimens of a given neighbourhood, may
acquire a natural active immunity against infection with <i>S. duttoni</i>.</p>

<p><i>S. duttoni</i>, or a closely allied form (by some termed <i>S. novyi</i>), occurs
in Colombia, and is spread by the tick <i>Ornithodorus turicata</i>. In
Panama a similar spirochÃ¦te is probably spread by <i>O. talaje</i>.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>SpirochÃ¦ta gallinarum</b>, Stephens and Christophers, 1905<br />
(= <b>SpirochÃ¦ta marchouxi</b>, Nuttall, 1905).</p>

<p>This SpirochÃ¦te, which occurs in fowls and is pathogenic, is
transmitted by the tick <i>Argas persicus</i>. It is about 10&nbsp;Âµ to 20&nbsp;Âµ long.
There is a pathogenic spirochÃ¦te known to occur in geese, named by
Sakharoff (1891) <i>S. anserina</i>, and found in Caucasia. This may be
the same as <i>S. gallinarum</i>, in which case the name <i>S. anserina</i> will
have priority. These organisms cause fever, diarrhÅa, anÃ¦mia and
death. The life history of the avian pathogenic spirochÃ¦tes has been
studied by Balfour, by Hindle<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> and by Fantham.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> It is essentially
similar to that of <i>S. duttoni</i>.</p>

<p>Marchoux and Couvy<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> (1913) consider that the âfragmentation of
the chromatinâ in spirochÃ¦tes is a process of degeneration. Working
with <i>A. persicus</i> and <i>S. gallinarum</i>, they state that a large number of
the spirochÃ¦tes ingested by the Argas almost immediately pass
through the wall of the alimentary canal and appear in the hÃ¦mocÅlic
fluid. Marchoux and Couvy consider that Leishmanâs granules
may be found in the Malpighian tubules of various Arachnids. They
found spirochÃ¦tes in the cephalic glands of infected Argas. They
consider that spirochÃ¦tes remain as wavy spirochÃ¦tes within the tick,
if they are to be infective, though the spirochÃ¦tes may become so thin
as to be invisible! The latter argument is obviously weak, and it
was never asserted that all granules in the Malpighian tubules of
infected ticks were derived from spirochÃ¦tes. With dark-ground<span class="pagenum" title="120"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>
illumination small, refractile spirochÃ¦tal granules may be seen to grow
into spirochÃ¦tes. The granule phase of spirochÃ¦tes has recently
been discussed by Fantham<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> (1914).</p>


<p class="spec"><b>SpirochÃ¦ta recurrentis</b>, Lebert, 1874.</p>

<p class="syn">Syn.: <i>SpirochÃ¦ta obermeieri</i>, Cohn, 1875.</p>

<p>This organism was discovered by Obermeier (1873) in cases of
relapsing fever in Berlin. Short forms 7&nbsp;Âµ to 9&nbsp;Âµ long, and longer
(probably adult) forms, 16&nbsp;Âµ to 19&nbsp;Âµ, are found in the blood. The
width is 0Â·25&nbsp;Âµ. Parasites 12&nbsp;Âµ or 13&nbsp;Âµ long are often observed.</p>

<p>The spirochÃ¦te is found in the blood during febrile attacks and
relapses, but not during intervening periods. It can be inoculated
into monkeys, rats and mice. It can live in the bed-bug, <i>Cimex
lectularius</i>, and Nuttall has succeeded in transmitting <i>S. recurrentis</i>
from mouse to mouse by the bites of the same bug. The French
investigators Sergent and Foley (1908â9) in Algeria, and Nicolle,
Blaizot and Conseil (1912) in Tunis, have shown experimentally that
<i>S. recurrentis</i> (var. <i>berbera</i>) is transmitted by lice. The latter workers
also demonstrated the method of infection that commonly occurs,
namely, by the scratching of the skin and crushing of lice containing
spirochÃ¦tes on the excoriated surface of the body.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lice as transmitting agents for relapsing fever were indicated by Mackie<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> in
1907. An epidemic among Indian school children furnished the materials.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> It was
noted that out of 170 boys, 137 were infected, and the boys were very verminous.
Among the girls, 35 out of 114 suffered, and few lice were found on them. Twenty-four
per cent. of the lice taken from the boys contained spirochÃ¦tes as compared
with 3 per cent. of those from the girls. As the epidemic died out among the boys,
the lice also became fewer, and an increase in the number of cases among the girls
coincided with an increase in the number of lice. SpirochÃ¦tes were found in the
gut, Malpighian tubules and genital organs of the lice. Mackie thought that infection
of the patients was brought about by the regurgitation of the spirochÃ¦tes when
the lice fed, but proof of this was lacking.</p></div>

<p>In 1912, Nicolle, Blaizot and Conseil,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> working in Tunis and
using chiefly an Algerian strain of relapsing fever spirochÃ¦tes (sometimes
called <i>S. berbera</i>), showed by direct experiments that infection
by means of the bites of <i>Pediculus vestimenti</i> and <i>P. capitis</i> was
untenable. As many as 4,707 infected lice were fed on one man, and
6,515 on another occasion were allowed to bite a man after they
had fed on a monkey heavily infected with spirochÃ¦tes, yet no
infection of the man followed. Examination of the lice showed
that the spirochÃ¦tes left the gut soon after they were ingested, and<span class="pagenum" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>
passed into the body cavity, which swarmed with spirochÃ¦tes. The
contents of the alimentary tract and the fÃ¦ces of the lice alike were
uninfective. The spirochÃ¦tes did not reappear in the gut till eight
days after an infective feed, but some persisted as late as the nineteenth
day when kept at 28Â°&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>It was noted that the irritation due to the lice caused scratching,
and that thereby lice became crushed on to the skin. An emulsion
was made of two infected lice and rubbed on to the slightly excoriated
skin of one of the above workers. Infection followed five days
later. A drop of emulsion placed on the conjunctiva of the human
eye produced spirochÃ¦tosis after an incubation of seven days. The
body contents of such lice, then, produce infection when they reach
the blood by any excoriated or penetrable surface. The stages leading
up to infection in nature briefly are: The irritation due to the louse
bites causes scratching, and the lice are crushed on to the skin. The
slight abrasion is quite sufficient to permit the entry of the parasite.
The louse bite alone is harmless. Infection by way of the eye is
quite probable in Africa, remembering the constant trouble due to
sand, dust, insects, etc., resulting in frequent touching of the eyes.</p>

<p>The spirochÃ¦tes occur in the body fluid of the lice and can pass
in it to the adjacent organs. Thus they probably find their way into
the genital organs, and into the eggs of the lice. Eggs laid twenty
to thirty days after the parent became infected have retained the
infection, and the larvÃ¦ issuing from such eggs must have contained
some form of spirochÃ¦tes, for an emulsion of either the eggs or
the larvÃ¦ produced spirochÃ¦tosis when inoculated into monkeys.
Further details regarding the spirochÃ¦tosis in the eggs of the lice and
in the larvÃ¦ are needed. Hereditary infection, however, has been
demonstrated, but is not very common. Sergent and Foley (1914)
state that the spirochÃ¦te possesses a very small and virulent form
which it assumes during apyrexial periods in man and during a
period following an infecting meal in the louse. Nicolle and Blanc
(1914) find that the organisms are infective in the louse just before
they reappear as spirochÃ¦tes. Nicolle and Blaizot found that female
lice were more susceptible to spirochÃ¦tes than males, four times
as many females as males being infected.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tictin (1897) found <i>S. recurrentis</i> in bugs recently fed on patients, and infected a
monkey with the fluids of crushed bugs. Karlinski (1902) found the spirochÃ¦tes
in bed-bugs in infected houses. There is some other evidence to show that bugs
may transmit the spirochÃ¦te in Nature. Further researches are needed regarding
the relationship of bed-bugs and human spirochÃ¦tosis.</p></div>

<p>Multiplication of <i>S. recurrentis</i> is by longitudinal and transverse
division (including so-called âincurvationâ), and the organism forms
small, ovoid bodies (âcoccoidâ bodies) in the same way as <i>S. duttoni</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span></p>

<p><i>S. recurrentis</i> is the cause of European relapsing fever, and a
number of possible varieties of it are associated with relapsing fevers
in other parts of the world. Such spirochÃ¦tes only differ by biological
reactions, such as acquired immunity tests. They <span class="nowrap">include:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>S. rossii</i>, the agent of East African relapsing fever; <i>S. novyi</i>, the
agent of North American relapsing fever; <i>S. carteri</i>, the agent of
Indian relapsing fever; <i>S. berbera</i>, the agent of North African and
Egyptian relapsing fever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Other Human SpirochÃ¦tes</span> <span class="nowrap">are:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>S. schaudinni.</i> This organism, according to Prowazek, is the
agent of ulcus tropicum. It varies in length from 10&nbsp;Âµ to 20&nbsp;Âµ.</p>

<p><i>S. aboriginalis</i> has been found in cases of granuloma inguinale
in British New Guinea and Western Australia. It also occurs in
dogs, and may not be truly parasitic.</p>

<p><i>S. vincenti.</i> This spirochÃ¦te is 12&nbsp;Âµ to 25&nbsp;Âµ in length, tapers at
both ends and has few coils. It has been associated with angina
vincenti. It often occurs in company with fusiform bacilli.</p>

<p><i>S. bronchialis</i>, found by Castellani in 1907 in cases of bronchitis
in Ceylon. The parasites are delicate, but show morphological
variation. This organism is important and has since been found
in the West Indies, India, Philippine Islands and various parts of
Africa, such as the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Uganda and West Africa.
It has recently been the subject of research by Chalmers and
OâFarrell, Taylor, and Fantham.</p>

<p><i>S. phagedenis</i> was found by Noguchi in a ten days old ulcerated
swelling of the labium. The organism shows much variation in size,
being 4&nbsp;Âµ to 30&nbsp;Âµ in length.</p>

<p><i>S. refringens</i> (Schaudinn, 1905) occurs in association with
<i>Treponema pallidum</i> in syphilitic lesions, but is non-pathogenic. It
is 20&nbsp;Âµ to 35&nbsp;Âµ long and 0Â·5&nbsp;Âµ to 0Â·75&nbsp;Âµ broad, being larger than
<i>T. pallidum</i> and more easily stained.</p>

<p>Various spirochÃ¦tes have also been notified in vomits, chiefly in
Australia; others from the human intestinal tract, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>S. eurygyrata</i>;
<i>S. stenogyrata</i> (Werner); <i>S. hachaizÃ¦</i> (Kowalski), in cholera motions;
<i>S. buccalis</i> (Cohn, 1875) and <i>S. dentium</i> occurring in the human
mouth and in carious teeth (<i>S. dentium</i>, Koch, 1877, being the
smaller); <i>S. acuminata</i> and <i>S. obtusa</i> found by Castellani in open
sores in cases of yaws.</p>

<p>Animal spirochÃ¦tes of economic importance i<span class="nowrap">nclude:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>S. anserina</i>, highly pathogenic to geese.</p>

<p><i>S. gallinarum</i> (= <i>S. marchouxi</i>) in fowls. (See p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_119">119</a>.)</p>

<p><i>S. theileri</i> in cattle and <i>S. ovina</i> in sheep also occur in Africa;
their pathogenicity is not clear.</p>

<p><i>S. laverani</i> (= <i>S. muris</i>), occurring in the blood of and pathogenic<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
to mice, is probably the smallest spirochÃ¦te from the blood,
being only 3&nbsp;Âµ to 6&nbsp;Âµ long.</p>

<p>Numerous spirochÃ¦tes have been recorded from the guts of
various mammals, birds, fishes, amphibia and insects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cultivation of SpirochÃ¦tes.</span>&mdash;Cultures of spirochÃ¦tes have
been made with little success or with great difficulty until comparatively
recently, when Noguchi (1912) devised a means whereby he
has cultivated most of the pathogenic spirochÃ¦tes as well as some
Treponemata.</p>

<p>Noguchi has now cultivated <i>S. duttoni</i>, <i>S. recurrentis</i>, <i>S. rossii</i>,
<i>S. novyi</i> and <i>S. gallinarum</i> from the blood; <i>S. phagedenis</i><a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> from human
phagedÃ¦nic lesions; <i>S. refringens</i><a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> and spirochÃ¦tes from the teeth.</p>

<p>His method is as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A piece of fresh, sterile tissue, usually rabbit kidney, is placed in a
sterile test-tube. A few drops of citrated blood from the heart of an
infected animal, <i>e.g.</i>, rat or mouse, is added, and about 15&nbsp;c.c. of sterile
ascitic or hydrocÅle fluid is poured quickly into the tube. Some of
the tubes are covered with a layer of sterile paraffin oil, others are
left uncovered. The tubes are incubated at 37Â°&nbsp;C. The best results
are obtained if the blood is taken from an animal forty-eight to seventy-two
hours after it has been inoculated, that is, before the spirochÃ¦tes
reach their maximum multiplicative period in the blood. The presence
of some oxygen seems indispensable for these blood spirochÃ¦tes, and
they fail to develop <i>in vacuo</i> or in an atmosphere of hydrogen.</p>

<p>For subcultures, 0Â·5&nbsp;c.c. of a culture is added to the medium
instead of citrated blood, and it is useful to add a little fresh, normal
blood, either human or from an animal, such as a rat.</p>

<p>Noguchi found that the events in cultures <span class="nowrap">were:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>S. duttoni</i>,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> maximum multiplication on the eighth to ninth day;
disintegration beginning on the tenth day, spirochÃ¦tes disappeared
after about the fifteenth day. No diminution of virulence was found
at the ninth day.</p>

<p>All the above spirochÃ¦tes showed undoubted longitudinal division
and transverse division was observed in part.</p>

<p><i>S. gallinarum</i><a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> can be cultivated as above, but transverse division<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
was usual here. Maximum growth occurred in the culture about the
fifth day.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Treponemata.</span></h5>

<p>The genus <i>Treponema</i> (Schaudinn, 1905), includes minute, thread-like
organisms, with spirally coiled bodies, the spirals being preformed
or fixed. No membrane or crista is present, according to Schaudinn,
though a slight one is said by Blanchard to be present in the organism
of yaws. The ends of the organisms are tapering and pointed.
Multiplication is by longitudinal and transverse division. The most
important members of the genus are <i>T. pallidum</i>, the agent of syphilis,
and <i>T. pertenue</i>, which is responsible for frambÅsia or yaws.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Treponema pallidum</b>, Schaudinn, 1905.</p>

<p class="syn">Syn.: <i>SpirochÃ¦ta pallida</i>.</p>

<p><i>Treponema pallidum</i> was first described by Schaudinn and Hoffmann
in 1905 under the name of <i>SpirochÃ¦ta pallida</i>. It has also been
described under the names
of <i>Spironema pallida</i>, <i>Microspironema
pallida</i> and
<i>Trypanosoma luis</i>. Siegel
in 1905 described an organism
which he called <i>Cytorhyctes
luis</i> and considered
to be the agent of syphilis.
Schaudinn reinvestigated
Siegelâs work and found
<i>T. pallidum</i>, which he considered
to be the causal
agent of the disease, and
pronounced against <i>Cytorhyctes
luis</i>. It is probable
now that both workers
were correct, for Balfour
(1911) has seen the emission
of minute granules
or âcoccoidâ bodies from <i>T. pallidum</i> and these granules probably
correspond to the <i>C. luis</i> of Siegel. Recently E.&nbsp;H. Ross, having
observed a spirochÃ¦te stage in the development of Kurloff bodies,
thinks that <i>T. pallidum</i> is a stage in the life-history of a Lymphocytozoon.
MacDonagh has also described a complicated and somewhat
similar cycle, but these observations require further study and
confirmation.</p>

Castellani and Chalmers.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>T. pallidum</i> varies from 4&nbsp;Âµ to 10&nbsp;Âµ in length, its average length
being 7&nbsp;Âµ, while its width is usually about 0Â·25&nbsp;Âµ. Longer individuals<span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>
of 16&nbsp;Âµ to 20&nbsp;Âµ have been recorded. The body has from eight to ten
spiral turns and forms a tapering process at each end (fig.&nbsp;56). The
organism is most difficult to stain, and its internal structure is little
known. It is possibly like that of <i>SpirochÃ¦ta duttoni</i> or <i>S. balbianii</i>,
as the âgranule sheddingâ observed by Balfour is strongly suggestive
of the formation of resistant bodies by those spirochÃ¦tes. Hoffmann
(1912) has seen the formation of spores in <i>T. pallidum</i>.</p>

<p>The Treponemata occur in the primary
and secondary sores, but are difficult to
find in the tertiary eruptions of syphilis.
Noguchi and Moore (1913) and Mott<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>
(1913) have demonstrated <i>T. pallidum</i> in
the brain in cases of general paralysis of
the insane. Marie and Levaditi (1914),
however, consider that the treponeme
found in the brain in such cases is
different from <i>T. pallidum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cultivation</span> <i>of T. pallidum</i>.&mdash;This has

</div>

<p>The apparatus consists of two glass
tubes, the upper being connected to the
lower by a narrower tube passing through
a rubber cork (fig.&nbsp;57). Both tubes are
carefully sterilized.</p>

<p>A piece of fresh, sterile rabbitâs kidney
is placed in the lower tube, which is
filled with ascitic fluid, or ascitic fluid
and bouillon mixture. The tube is inoculated
with syphilitic material and
corked by inserting the upper tube. In the bottom of the upper tube
a piece of sterile rabbitâs kidney is placed and syphilitic material
poured over it. A mixture of one part ascitic fluid and two parts of
slightly alkaline agar is then poured over the tissue and allowed to
solidify. When solid, a layer of sterile paraffin oil is poured on top
of it, and the top plugged with cotton wool (fig.&nbsp;57). The whole is then
incubated at 37Â°&nbsp;C. for two or three weeks. The tissue removes traces
of oxygen from the lower levels of the medium and also probably<span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>
provides a special form of nourishment. At first <i>T. pallidum</i> grows in
the solid medium, and then when the cultural conditions in the lower
fluid portion become favourable, the organisms migrate thither and
multiply abundantly. At first the culture is impure, but after several
transferences a pure culture is obtained readily.</p>

<p>The syphilitic material for culture is prepared by cutting off
pieces of tissue from the lesions, washing in sterile salt solution
containing 1 per cent. sodium citrate, and then emulsifying the
tissue in a mortar with sodium citrate.</p>

<p>Good cultures show rapid multiplication, which is invariably
by longitudinal division.</p>

<p>In his various cultivation experiments Noguchi<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> found morphological
and pathogenic variations in <i>T. pallidum</i>. Three forms of the
organism were found, namely, thicker, average and thinner types.
The lesions caused in the testicle of the rabbit differ according to
the variety inoculated, but more work is necessary on the subject.</p>

<p>Noguchi<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> has cultivated a separate organism, <i>T. calligyrum</i>,
from the surface of human genital or anal lesions, either syphilitic
or non-syphilitic. It is apparently non-pathogenic, and is 6&nbsp;Âµ to
14&nbsp;Âµ long.</p>

<p>Hata (1913)<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> has modified the Noguchi technique for the cultivation
of spirochÃ¦tes and treponemes, with a view to simplification and
convenience. Hata substitutes normal horse serum for ascitic fluid
and the âbuffy coatâ of the clot of horse blood in place of the small
pieces of rabbitâs kidney. It is unnecessary to place sterile paraffin on
the surface of the medium.</p>

<p>The horse serum is mixed with twice its volume of physiological
saline solution. The mixture is placed in tubes which are heated on a
water-bath at 58Â°&nbsp;C., the temperature being raised gradually until it
reaches 70Â° or 71Â°&nbsp;C. in three hours. The tubes are then heated at
71Â°&nbsp;C. for half an hour. After cooling, the contents will consist of an
opaque semi-coagulated mass. This semi-coagulated serum and saline
mixture may be substituted for Noguchiâs ascitic fluid.</p>

<p>The buff coagulum is cut into small pieces, about 1&nbsp;c.c. in volume.
They must be forced with a sterile glass rod to the bottom of the semi-coagulated
serum and saline mixture. The medium is inoculated with
a small quantity of infected blood and kept at 37Â°&nbsp;C. In the case of
<i>S. recurrentis</i>, growth of spirochÃ¦tes is observed on the second day,
reaching a maximum in five to seven days. The growth of the
organisms proceeds rather more slowly, they live for a longer period
and maintain their virulence better than in Noguchiâs medium.</p>

<p class="syn">Syn.: <i>SpirochÃ¦ta pertenuis</i>; <i>S. pallidula</i>, Castellani, 1905.</p>

<p>Castellani discovered the organism in 1905, in scrapings of yaws
pustules. He first described it under the name of <i>SpirochÃ¦ta pertenuis</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span>&mdash;<i>Treponema perÂ­tenue</i>.
(After CastelÂ­lani and Chalmers.)</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>Treponema pertenue</i> (fig.&nbsp;58), though delicate and slender, shows
great morphological variation both in length and thickness. It
may be short, <i>e.g.</i>, 7&nbsp;Âµ, but can attain 18&nbsp;Âµ to 20&nbsp;Âµ in length and may
be even larger. In cultures made by Noguchi, thick, medium and
thin forms were found, each giving rise to a different type of frambÅsial
lesion when inoculated into the testicles of rabbits, thus
suggesting the possibility of the occurrence of varieties of <i>T. pertenue</i>.</p>

<p>The organism is difficult to stain, but occasionally deeper
staining granules are found along its body. They may represent
a diffuse nucleus. Granule formation
similar to that of <i>T. pallidum</i> has been
observed by Ranken, using dark-ground
illumination.</p>

<p>Many experiments have been made
with a view to establishing the identity
of the organism of yaws and also of
differentiating between the causative
agents of yaws and syphilis. Both
monkeys and the human subject have
been experimentally inoculated with yaws
material and have developed the disease.</p>

<p>In an early experiment, negroes were
inoculated with the secretion from lesions
of yaws. All of them developed the
disease, nodules appearing, chiefly at the
seat of inoculation, in from twelve to twenty days, followed by the
usual eruption. Similar results were obtained with thirty-two Chinese
prisoners, who were inoculated with yaws, twenty-eight becoming
infected.</p>

<p>A naturally infected yaws patient when inoculated with syphilis,
contracted that infection, thus showing that yaws does not confer
immunity to syphilis. This has also been observed naturally, when
yaws patients have contracted syphilis.</p>

<p>Experiments with monkeys have been successfully performed.
The incubation period varies from sixteen to ninety-two days.
Lesions appear first at the seat of inoculation, and in some
monkeys the eruption is localized to this spot, though the infection is
general, <i>T. pertenue</i> occurring in the spleen, lymphatics, etc. Monkeys
inoculated with splenic blood of a yaws patient, and also sometimes
with blood from the general circulation, have become infected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="128"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span></p>

<p>Castellani and others have shown that monkeys successfully
inoculated with syphilis do not become immune to yaws, and vice-versÃ¢.</p>

<p>Craig and Ashburn, using the monkey <i>Cynomolgus philippinensis</i>,
found these animals susceptible to yaws but not to syphilis.</p>

<p>The ulcerated lesions of frambÅsia are rapidly invaded by
numerous bacteria as well as by different spirochÃ¦tes, of which
Castellani has described three distinct species. One is identical
with <i>SpirochÃ¦ta refringens</i>, Schaudinn, the other two are thin and
delicate. One, <i>S. obtusa</i>, has blunt ends; the other <i>S. acuminata</i>, has
pointed ends. <i>T. pertenue</i> is also present.</p>

<p>The reasons for considering <i>T. pertenue</i> to be the specific cause of
frambÅsia <span class="nowrap">are:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) <i>T. pertenue</i> is the only organism present in non-ulcerated
papules, in the spleen and in the lymphatics of yaws patients, or
of monkeys artificially infected with the disease. By no method
has any other organism been obtained.</p>

<p>(2) Extract of frambÅsia material, free from all organisms other
than <i>T. pertenue</i>, reproduces the disease if inoculated.</p>

<p>(3) Extract of frambÅsia material deprived by filtration of
<i>T. pertenue</i> is no longer infective on inoculation.</p>

<p>The method of infection is contaminative, by direct contact.
Women in Ceylon are frequently infected by their children. Any
slight skin abrasion is sufficient to admit the parasite. In some
cases, insects may carry the disease from person to person, and even
in hospitals, when dressings are removed, it has been noticed that
flies greedily suck the secretion from the ulcers. <i>T. pertenue</i> has
been recovered from flies that have fed on yaws, and monkeys have
contracted the disease when flies were placed and retained on them
for a short time, after the insects had fed on yaws material.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cultivation</span>.&mdash;<i>T. pertenue</i> has been cultivated by Noguchi, who
finds three types of parasites in his cultures, as before mentioned. Its
multiplication is by longitudinal division.</p>

<p>Noguchi<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> (1912), has cultivated species of Treponema from the
human mouth, e.g., <i>T. macrodentium</i>, <i>T. microdentium</i> and <i>T. mucosum</i>,
the latter from pyorrhea alveolaris. These parasites in the past may
have been confused under the name <i>SpirochÃ¦ta dentium</i>.</p>


<h4>Class III. <b>SPOROZOA</b>, Leuckart, 1879.</h4>

<p>The third group of the Protozoa consists entirely of parasitic
organisms forming the class known as the Sporozoa or spore-producing
animals. The members of this class are characterized<span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
by possessing very great powers of multiplication, coupled with a
capacity for producing forms that serve for the transference of the
organisms to other hosts. These reproductive bodies, whether for
increase of numbers within one host or for transmission to another
host, are called spores. But, strictly, the term spore should be used
only in the latter connection, when a protective or resistant coat
known as a sporocyst envelops the body of the spore.</p>

<p>The Sporozoa are widely distributed, occurring in various tissues
and organs of Annelids, Molluscs, Arthropods, and Vertebrates.
Their food, which is fluid, is absorbed osmotically. The life-cycle
of a SporozoÃ¶n may be completed within one host or may be distributed
between two different hosts.</p>

<p>The Sporozoa were divided by Schaudinn into two groups or
sub-classes, called (1) the <b>Telosporidia</b>, and (2) the <b>Neosporidia</b>.</p>

<p>The Telosporidia are Sporozoa in which the reproductive phase
of the parasites is distinct from the growing or trophic phase, and
follows after it. The Neosporidia include Sporozoa in which growth
and spore-formation go on simultaneously. This classification is not
final, for certain exceptions and difficulties are already known with
regard to it. It is possible that the class Sporozoa is not a natural
entity, but should be replaced by two classes of equal rank, corresponding
in most respects with the Telosporidia and Neosporidia.</p>

<p>The <b>Telosporidia</b> comprise the <b>Gregarinida</b>, the <b>Coccidiidea</b>, and
the <b>HÃ¦mosporidia</b>. Doflein combines the two latter orders into one
known as the <b>Coccidiomorpha</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>Neosporidia</b> comprise the <b>Myxosporidia</b>, the <b>Microsporidia</b>,
the <b>Actinomyxidia</b>, the <b>Sarcosporidia</b>, and the <b>Haplosporidia</b>.
Doflein combines the first three orders into one, the <b>Cnidosporidia</b>.</p>


<p class="spec">Sub-Class. TELOSPORIDIA, Schaudinn.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Knowledge of the Gregarinida probably goes back as far as the year 1684, when
Redi observed gregarines in the crab, <i>Cancer pagurus</i>. Von Cavolini (1787) found
them in <i>Cancer depressus</i>. The name <i>Gregarina</i> was created by L. Dufour (1828),
who observed masses of these organisms in the gut of insects of different orders.
Hammerschmidt (1838) and von Siebold found rich infestations in insects, while
Dujardin (1835) and Henle described various genera from segmented worms.
Henle (1835) also observed cysts containing ânavicellÃ¦â in the sperm-sacs of
segmented worms, and attention was drawn to his researches by the discovery by
von Siebold (1839) of âpseudonavicellÃ¦â in the gut of <i>Sciara nitidicollis</i>. Up to this
time many workers considered the gregarines to be worms, but KÃ¶lliker (1845)
investigated many of them and maintained their unicellular nature, while Steinâs
work (1848) showed the interrelation of the pseudonavicellÃ¦ and the gregarines.<span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>
The discovery of amÅboid germs in the pseudonavicellÃ¦ by LieberkÃ¼hn (1855) and
the demonstration of myonemes further aided in the elucidation of their true
systematic position. The entire process of conjugation, of which Dufour had seen
one phase, was followed by Giard under the microscope.</p>

<p>From 1873 onwards AimÃ© Schneider made important additions to the knowledge
of the morphology, life-history, and systematic position of numerous gregarines.
BÃ¼tschli (1881) and L. LÃ©ger (1892) also contributed much work on the subject. The
discoveries of Schaudinn with regard to the life-cycle of Coccidia gave a fresh
stimulus to the study of the Gregarines, whereby the life-cycles of numerous forms
and the phases thereof have been elucidated.</p>

<p>Asexual multiplication is not common among the Gregarines, but is known to
occur in the sub-order Schizogregarinea, formerly known as the AmÅbosporidia.</p>

<p>Although the Gregarinida are not known to be parasitic in man or other vertebrates,
they are of great interest, inasmuch as they are among the earliest known
Sporozoa, and therefore will be briefly described here.</p></div>

<p>The Gregarines are usually elongate, somewhat
flattened organisms (figs.&nbsp;59, 60), whose bodies are
enclosed in an elastic and often thick cuticle. The
enclosed living substance shows a separation into
ectoplasm and endoplasm, as is common among
Protozoa. The cuticle is sometimes regarded as the
outer portion or epicyte of the ectoplasm. A single,
vesicular, spherical, or elliptical, large nucleus, with
its chromatin concentrated to form a spherical
karyosome, is present. The body of some gregarines
may be divided by ingrowing ectoplasmic
partitions or septa, and are then said to be âseptateâ or
âpolycystidâ (fig.&nbsp;61). Other gregarines remain simple and non-septate,
and are termed âmonocystidâ (fig.&nbsp;59). The monocystid gregarines
occur especially in the body cavity of ChÃ¦topoda and Insecta, more
rarely in Echinodermata, in the parenchyma of Platyhelminthes,<span class="pagenum" title="131"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
also in the gut of Tunicata and Insecta (fig.&nbsp;60) and in the seminal
vesicles of Annelida. In the polycystid gregarines a single septum only
is present as a rule, and thus the body presents two portions: (1) an
anterior portion termed the protomerite; (2) a
posterior, larger portion, known as the deutomerite,
which generally contains the nucleus.
The protomerite is often modified anteriorly
to form an organ of attachment, termed the
epimerite (fig.&nbsp;61), which is developed from the
pointed rostrum of the sporozoite or primary
infecting young gregarine. The structure of
the epimerite may be complicated, being provided
with hooks, spines, knobs, and other
appendages. An extension of the polycystid
condition is seen in <i>TÃ¦niocystis mira</i> LÃ©ger
(from the dipteran larva, <i>Ceratopogon solstitialis</i>),
whose body shows a number of partitions,
giving the organism a superficial resemblance
to a tapeworm.</p>

<p>The ectoplasm of a gregarine exhibits three
layers: (1) An epicyte (cuticle) externally of
which the epimerite is composed; (2) a
sarcocyte which forms the septa if present;
(3) the deeper myocyte layer containing contractile
elements in the form of fibrils or threads
termed myonemes (fig.&nbsp;62).</p>

</div>

<p>The endoplasm is fluid and granular, containing
many enclosures, which are of the nature of reserve food
materials. They consist of fat droplets
or of paraglycogen, and give
the organisms an opaque appearance.
<i>Lithocystis</i> contains crystals
of calcium oxalate in its endoplasm.</p>

<p>Many gregarines are capable of
active movements, though they do not
possess obvious locomotor organs.
The movement is of a smooth,
gliding character and two suggestions
have been put forward to
explain it. According to Schewiakoff,
a gelatinous substance is secreted between
the layers of the ectoplasm.
This is extruded posteriorly and thus
the animal is pushed forward. On the other hand, Crawley considers
that the movements are produced by contractions of the myonemes.<span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>
These two explanations are probably correct as far as each goes, and
are to be regarded as supplementary to one another.</p>

<p>Occasionally, temporary associations of gregarines are formed
by a number of individuals adhering to
one another end to end. Such temporary
associations are examples of syzygy. Such
syzygies must not be confused with true
associations which form an essential part of
the life-cycle.</p>

<p>The life-cycle of a relatively simple gregarine,
such as <i>Monocystis agilis</i> (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_59">59</a>),
parasitic in earthworms, may now be considered.
The gregarines, being members of
the Sporozoa, produce spores at one phase
of the life-cycle. Each gregarine spore
(fig.&nbsp;63) develops within itself a number of
minute, sickle-shaped or vermicular bodies,
known as sporozoites or primary infecting
germs. Eight sporozoites are often formed
within each spore. When absorbed by a new
host, the spore softens and the sporozoites issue from it. They are
capable of active movement and may or may not enter a cell, such as
one of those of the digestive tract, or, as in <i>Monocystis</i>, a cell lining the
vesicula seminalis which becomes a sperm-cell aggregate (sperm morula).
When the sporozoite has reached the place of its choice in the host
it ceases active movements and proceeds to feed passively on the fluid
substances around it, whether they be those of tissues or body fluids.
This passive, growing and feeding form is known as the trophozoite.
After a trophic existence of longer or shorter duration, the trophozoite
ceases to feed and prepares for reproduction. Two trophozoites
associate together, each of them first becoming somewhat rounded.
The two trophozoites, now known as sporonts or gametocytes, become
invested in a single common envelope or cyst (fig.&nbsp;64, <i>a</i>). The nucleus
of each gametocyte then divides by a series of binary fissions (fig.&nbsp;64, <i>b</i>),
and the daughter nuclei thus produced arrange themselves at the
periphery of the parent cells (fig.&nbsp;64, <i>c</i>). Cytoplasm collects around
each of these nuclei, and thus a number of gametes are formed within
each gametocyte. The gametes for a time exhibit active movements,
and ultimately ripe gametes of different parentage fuse in pairs, that
is, conjugation occurs (fig.&nbsp;64, <i>d</i>). In this way zygotes are produced,
the nucleus of each zygote being formed by the fusion of two gamete
nuclei.</p>

</div>

<p>The zygote grows slightly and becomes oval or elongate, and at
this period is often called the sporoblast. It then secretes an external<span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span><span class="pagenum hide" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
membrane, the sporocyst. Nuclear division occurs inside the sporocyst
by a series of three binary fissions (fig.&nbsp;64, <i>e</i>), so that each sporocyst,
now usually referred to as a spore, contains eight nuclei. The
cytoplasm collects around each nucleus and eight vermicular sporozoites
are produced within each spore (fig.&nbsp;64, <i>f</i>), thus completing
the life-cycle.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that in the above life-cycle no asexual multiplication
occurs. These organisms, such as <i>Monocystis</i>, are known as
the Eugregarines, and include the majority of the gregarines. The
remainder, which have introduced schizogony into their life-cycle, are
known as the Schizogregarines.</p>

<p>There are variations in the morphology and life-cycle of gregarines
besides those that have been mentioned. It is not within the scope
of this book to discuss them in detail, but the following may be
<span class="nowrap">noted:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Morphological differentiation of gametes may occur as in <i>Stylorhynchus
oblongatus</i> (fig.&nbsp;65), which differentiation is probably of a
sexual nature.</p>

<p>The sporocyst really consists of two layers, an epispore and an
endospore. Externally the spores of different gregarines show great
variety in shape and markings, and spines, or long processes may
be present (fig.&nbsp;66).</p>

<p>The resistant spores serve for the transmission of the gregarines
from host to host. The mode of infection is contaminative, the
spores expelled with the dejecta of one host being absorbed with the
food of a new host.</p>

<p>The Gregarinida may be classified as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sub-order I.&mdash;<b>Eugregarinea</b>, without schizogony.</p>

<p>Tribe 1.&mdash;<i>Acephalina</i>.&mdash;Without an epimerite and non-septate;
often âcÅlomicâ (body-cavity) parasites. <i>E.g.</i>: <i>Monocystis</i>, with<span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>
several species parasitic in the seminal vesicles of earthworms. Many
other genera parasitic in Echinodermata, Tunicata, Arthropoda, etc.</p>

<p>Tribe 2.&mdash;<i>Cephalina</i>.&mdash;With an epimerite, either temporarily or
permanently, in the trophic phase. Usually septate (except <i>DoliocystidÃ¦</i>).
Many families, genera and species. Common in the digestive
tracts of insects. <i>E.g.</i>: <i>Gregarina</i>, with several species, <i>Gregarina
ovata</i> in the earwig, <i>Gregarina blattarum</i> in the cockroach, <i>Stylorhynchus</i>
in beetles, <i>Pterocephalus</i> in centipedes, etc.</p>

<p>Hake (1839) first saw the organisms now termed Coccidia during his investigations
on the so-called coccidial nodules of rabbits. The opinions as to the nature of these
peculiar formations were very diverse. The discoverer considered them to be a sort
of pus corpuscle; Nasse (1843) took them for epithelial cells of the biliary passages,
others for helminthes, especially the ova of trematodes (Dujardin, KÃ¼chenmeister,
Gubler, etc). Remak (1845) was the first to draw attention to their relation to the
Psorospermia (Myxosporidia), and this investigator found them also in the small
intestine and vermiform appendix of rabbits. LieberkÃ¼hn (1854), who examined not
only the coccidia of rabbits, but found similar forms in the kidneys of frogs, likewise
called them definitely psorosperms. To differentiate MÃ¼llerâs psorosperms, which are
found in fishes, from those of rabbits, etc., the latter were called egg-shaped psorosperms
(Eimer), until R. Leuckart (1879) named them <i>Coccidia</i> and placed them in
a group of the Sporozoa analogous to that of the Gregarinida, Myxosporidia, etc.
Numerous works confirmed the occurrence of coccidia, not only in all classes of
vertebrate animals, but also in invertebrates (Mollusca, Myriapoda, Annelida, etc.).
A large number of genera and species have in the course of time been described which
inhabit the epithelium of the intestine and its appendages for choice, but are also
found in other organs (kidneys, spleen, ovaries, vas deferens, testicles). Some also
live in the connective tissue of various organs, more particularly of the intestine.</p>

<p>The knowledge of the development of the coccidia was of particular importance
in determining their classification. By means of encysted coccidia from the liver of
rabbits, Kauffmann (1847) first confirmed the fact that the cyst, which was partly or
entirely filled with granular contents, divided into three or four pale bodies (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_71">71</a>)
after a long sojourn in water. LieberkÃ¼hn observed the same process in the host in
the case of the coccidia of the kidney of the frog. Stieda (1865) studied more minutely
the changes that occur within the encysted coccidia of the liver of rabbits after the
death of the host. He discovered that the bodies now known as âsporesâ were
oval formations pointed at one pole, and surrounded by a delicate membrane, which
exhibited a certain thickness at the pointed extremity and enclosed a slightly bent
rodlet, expanding at either end into a strongly light-refracting globule; a finely
granular globule was present in the middle of the spore. Waldenburg (1862) saw the<span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
same phenomenon in coccidia from the epithelium of the villi and LieberkÃ¼hnâs
glands of the intestine of the rabbit; but the process in this case took place in a
much shorter time.</p>

<p>According to the discovery of Kloss (1855), the spores of the coccidia of the
urinary organ of the garden snail were formed in far greater numbers: the round
spores also harboured several (five to six) rodlets, which after the bursting of the
spore-envelope became free. Eimerâs researches (1870) afforded information
regarding a Coccidium from the intestine of the mouse, which was transformed <i>in
toto</i> into a âspore,â containing small sickle-shaped bodies. The fact was, moreover,
established that the little bodies left the delicate envelope when in the intestine,
made movements of flexion and extension, and were finally transformed into
amÅboid organisms, which apparently penetrated the epithelial cells; at all events,
similar bodies of various sizes were seen in these cells. Taking the immense
number of these parasites into account and the lack of any other cause, Eimer
attributed the sudden death of his mice to the <i>Gregarina falciformis</i>, as the parasite
was then called, just in the same way as a few years previously Reincke ascribed the
acute and fatal intestinal catarrh of rabbits to the invasion of intestinal coccidia.</p>

<p>All that had become known about coccidia up to 1879 was then compiled by
Leuckart, and completed by his own observations on the coccidia of the liver of the
rabbit. Experimental infections had already been conducted by Waldenburg (1862)
with intestinal coccidia of rabbits, and by Rivolta (1869â73) with the coccidia of fowls,
which experiments confirmed the importance of the spores, or bodies enclosed in them,
in the transmission of the parasites to other animals. Accordingly, it was assumed that
after the entry of the spores into the intestine the sporozoites were set free, actively
penetrated into the intestinal cells, where they grew into coccidia, and finally became
encysted. The further development, <i>i.e.</i>, the formation of spores, took place outside
the hostâs body in these cases; in other cases (Kloss, Eimer) it took place within
the host. Although much regarding the cycle of development was still hypothetical,
the ideas coincided with the observations, and were therefore universally regarded as
established. Further research confirmed this view in numerous new forms.</p>

<p>L. Pfeifferâs statements (1891) on the part that certain coccidia or their sporozoites
played, or seemed to play, as causes of disease gave a renewed impetus to the
investigation of the coccidia. The ingestion of even very numerous spores did not
appear to account for the mass infection so frequently observed, even after Balbiani
had confirmed the fact that there were two, and not one, sporozoites contained in every
spore of the coccidia of rabbits (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_72">72</a>). The hypothesis was therefore advanced
that the sporozoites or young coccidia were able to divide once again by sporulating.
The question was finally solved quite differently. R. Pfeiffer (1892) first confirmed
the fact that in addition to the well-known method of sporulation in the coccidia of
the rabbit that causes the infection of fresh hosts (âexogenous sporulationâ), an
enormous increase may follow in the already infected host in a manner that Eimer
first observed in the coccidia of the intestine of the mouse (âendogenous sporulationâ).
It had hitherto been believed that some of the species of coccidia increased
like the rabbit parasite, then known as <i>Coccidium oviforme</i>, and others like <i>Eimeria
falciformis</i>, and this difference had been made the foundation of a classification.
R. Pfeiffer was successful in observing the occurrence of both kinds of development
in the same species, and expressed the opinion that endogenous sporulation (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_73">73</a>),
which takes place within the host, was the cause of the mass-infection that is mostly
accompanied by serious consequences (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_74">74</a>).&nbsp;L. Pfeiffer sought, especially, to
demonstrate the correctness of this view as regards other species of coccidia
and for this purpose he utilized the experiences already published. Coccidia were
known to exist in a number of different hosts, and to propagate in some according<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
to the <i>Coccidium</i> type, in others according to the <i>Eimeria</i> type. It therefore was
reasoned that in this case it was not a question of two species belonging to different
genera living side by side, with a different mode of development, but of one species,
in the life of which both forms of development occurred alternately.</p>

<p>This interpretation of facts was combated especially by A. Schneider (1892) and by
LabbÃ©, but has, nevertheless, proved true, apart from the circumstance that Schuberg
succeeded in discovering the hitherto unknown <i>Coccidium</i> form in the intestine of
the mouse; and that, moreover, LÃ©ger confirmed the fact that there are no Arthropoda
in which Eimeria are not found together with coccidia. The question was
finally settled by experiments made by LÃ©ger with the coccidia of <i>Scolopendra
cingulata</i>, by Schaudinn and Siedlecki with those of <i>Lithobius forficatus</i>, and by
Simond with the coccidia of the rabbit. On Simondâs suggestion the sickle-shaped
germs corresponding to the sporozoites, which are formed by endogenous sporulation,
are generally termed merozoites; and in accordance with Schaudinnâs
suggestion, those individuals which form merozoites are termed schizonts, and
those which produce spores are called sporonts. In contradistinction to sporogony
(exogenous sporulation), the term schizogony (endogenous sporulation) is used.</p>

<p>The more minute examination of these processes at last led to the discovery of
sexual dimorphism, of copulation and of alternation of generations in the coccidia.
Schuberg was the first to consider the possibility of copulation in coccidia; in
addition to the formations which now are termed merozoites, he observed very
diminutive bodies (âmicrosporozoitesâ) in the coccidia of the intestine of the mouse,
which were able eventually to copulate. LabbÃ© confirmed this observation in some
of the species, and Simond expressed the opinion that bodies termed âchromatozoitesâ
occurred in all coccidia. Copulation itself was then observed by Schaudinn
and Siedlecki (1897). The copulating bodies were termed gametes. As, however, they
differed considerably one from the other, the males were called microgametes (<i>i.e.</i>,
the microsporozoites of LabbÃ© and the chromatozoites of Simond) and the females
macrogametes. After copulation was completed sporogony took place, and in the
cycle of development of one species this regularly alternated with schizogony (asexual
multiplication). Schaudinn in 1900 described in detail the life-cycle of <i>Eimeria</i>
(<i>Coccidium</i>) <i>schubergi</i>.</p>

<p>The recognition of this unsuspected complicated process was bound to effect
reforms in the classification of the coccidia; and all the forms that had been
regarded as developmental stages (<i>Eimeria</i>, etc.) had to be reconsidered.</p></div>

<p><i>Occurrence.</i>&mdash;The Coccidiidea in their mature condition usually
live within the epithelial cells of various organs, and by choice inhabit
those of the intestine and of its associated organs. They also occur
frequently in the excretory organs of mammals, birds, amphibia,
molluscs, arthropods, and may also be found in the testes and vas
deferens, but the statement that they live in henâs eggs, as well as
in the oviducts of fowls, has not been confirmed.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> Some species
inhabit the nuclei of cells, others live in the connective tissue, but<span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
their presence in the latter situation is probably only secondary,
that is, they have only reached it from the epithelium of the affected
organs.</p>

<p>The size of the Coccidiidea, corresponding as a rule to the capacity
of their habitat, is usually small, but there are said to be species
that attain a diameter of 1&nbsp;mm. Their form<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> is globular, oval, or
elliptical. External appendages are lacking, at least during the trophic
or vegetative period of their life, which is spent in epithelial cells,
within which they increase in size. Frequently one only is present
in each cell, but more can occur. The body substance is composed
of a more or less finely granular or distinctly alveolar protoplasm
which exhibits no differentiation into ecto- and endoplasm. All
species possess a nucleus that enlarges with their growth; sometimes
it only shows through the cytoplasm as a lighter spot, or may
even be quite concealed. It is vesicular, and besides containing very
delicate threads of chromatin in the clear nucleoplasm, it contains
generally only one large karyosome.</p>

<p>The infected epithelial cells degenerate sooner or later as the
parasite feeds on them (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_67">67</a>, <span class="lowercase smcap">II</span>-<span class="lowercase smcap">IV</span>). After their form has been
changed by the action of the growing parasite, they finally perish.
The cell membrane then alone surrounds the coccidia, which, at
least in the species sufficiently known, begin to propagate by an
asexual process (schizogony), the parasites themselves becoming
schizonts, as the initial stage is usually called. They differ from later
stages (sporonts or gametocytes), which resemble them in form, by
the absence of granulations in the cytoplasm, as well as by the
vesicular nucleus. The form is not always the same, for in some
cases, at least, many schizonts assume a globular form.</p>

<p>Schizogony (fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">V</span>-<span class="lowercase smcap">VII</span>) commences with a division of the
nucleus, which takes place in different ways in the various species.
This finally leads to the formation of numerous daughter nuclei
which become smaller and smaller, and which collect beneath
the surface of the schizonts. In some species the daughter nuclei
collect only in one half of the schizont. A part of the protoplasm
of the periphery now divides around each daughter nucleus, the
remaining part (residual body) being left in the centre or on one
side. The segments of the divided cytoplasm, each containing
a nucleus, assume a fusiform shape and become merozoites, which
very soon become free (fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">VIII</span>) and leave the residual body.
They are distinguishable from the very similar sporozoites (fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">I</span>),
as the merozoites possess a karyosome.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The merozoites move in a manner similar to that of the sporozoites. The movements
consist either of slow incurvations with subsequent straightenings, or annular
contractions along the entire extent of the body. In addition, there are gliding
movements similar to those of many gregarines, and brought about in a like manner
by the secretion at the posterior extremity of a gelatinous substance that hardens
rapidly.</p></div>

<p>The merozoites do not gain the open in the usual way, but are
destined to infect still further the same host by actively penetrating
into other epithelial cells of the affected organ. Here they continue
their growth and may again and again undergo schizogony. In the
Infusoria the repeated segmentations finally cease and are renewed
only after a conjugation. This is likewise the case with the Coccidia,
with the difference that in the latter the two conjugating individuals
(gametes) are differently constituted one from the other, whereas in
the Infusoria they are almost always similar.</p>

<p>When the schizogony ceases, the merozoites, that had penetrated
the epithelial cells and become trophozoites there, consist of two kinds
of differently constituted individuals. One kind possesses a clear
cytoplasm (fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">XII</span>), the other an opaque, richly granular cytoplasm
(fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">XI</span>), while both possess a vesicular nucleus with a karyosome.
In order to continue their development, the more granular individuals
must be fertilized, and are therefore termed either female gametes or,
on account of their size, macrogametes. The male individuals (microgametes)
necessary to conjugation, are formed in greater numbers
from the less dense microgametocytes or male mother-cells (fig.&nbsp;67,
<span class="lowercase smcap">XII</span>d). They are slender bodies consisting chiefly of nuclear substance,
and in most species bear two flagella of unequal length directed backwards,
the place of insertion of which varies according to the species
(fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">XII</span>e).</p>

<p>While the development of the microgametes is rapidly advancing
a change occurs in the nucleus of the female parent forms or macrogametocytes.
Parts of the karyosome are extruded (fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">XI</span>c), and
the nucleus loses at the same time its vesicular form. One macrogamete
results, after nuclear maturation, from one macrogametocyte.
By this time the macrogametes are capable of conjugation, and
the process takes place within the host, generally, however, outside
the affected and degenerated host cells. The microgametes that
have now become free from the very large residual body, crowd
around the mature macrogametes, which often send out a small
prominence (âcone of receptionâ or fertilization protuberance) for
their reception (fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">XIII</span>). As soon as a microgamete comes in
contact with this and penetrates into the cytoplasm of the macrogamete,
the latter surrounds itself with a membrane which prevents
the intrusion of other microgametes. The nucleus of the microgamete<span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>
that has gained entry unites with the nucleus of the macrogamete,
which latter is afterwards capable of forming the well-known
spores. The parasite is now called an encysted zygote or oÃ¶cyst. The
oÃ¶cysts of some other members of the Coccidiidea, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Eimeria avium</i>,
can form their walls prior to fertilization. In such cases, a weak spot
is left at one place in the cyst wall, forming a micropyle, that permits of
the entry of the male, immediately after which the micropyle is closed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The reduced nucleus of the macrogamete elongates on the entry of the microgamete,
and becomes a fertilization spindle to which the male pronucleus (from the
microgamete) becomes attached (fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">XIV</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">XV</span>). Thereupon the spindle
divides into two daughter nuclei (fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">XVI</span>) which assume a round shape. The
protoplasm at this stage may at once divide, or another segmentation of the daughter
nuclei may first occur. In the former case the two halves divide again, so that
finally four nucleated segments, the sporoblasts, are formed, whereas in the latter
case the four sporoblasts appear simultaneously (fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">XVII</span>). In both cases a
residual body of varying size is separated from the protoplasm of the oÃ¶cyst. As
a rule the oÃ¶cysts have already been discharged from the body of the host, and in
the manner described above, form the sporoblasts after a longer or shorter period
of incubation.</p></div>

<p>The sporoblasts are originally naked, but each soon secretes a
homogeneous membrane, the sporocyst, in which it becomes enveloped
(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_67">67</a>, <span class="lowercase smcap">XVIII</span>). After the segmentation of the nucleus the contents
divide into two sickle-shaped sporozoites, in addition to which there
is generally also a residual body (fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">XIX</span>).</p>

<p>This terminates the development. The spores are intended for
the infection of other hosts. If they reach the intestine of suitable
hosts, either free or enclosed in the oÃ¶cyst wall, the action of the
intestinal juices causes them to open and permits the escape of the
sporozoites (fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">XX</span>). The latter move exactly like the merozoites
and soon make their way into epithelial cells (fig.&nbsp;67, <span class="lowercase smcap">I</span>), where they
become schizonts, and thus repeat the life cycle.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Although our knowledge of the development of the coccidia is but of recent date,
yet it already extends to a large number of species, which exhibit various deviations
from the cycle of development described above. For instance, in addition to
differences in the gametocytes, the schizonts of <i>Adelea</i> and <i>Cyclospora</i> also show
differentiation and give rise to macromerozoites and micromerozoites, whilst in
<i>Adelea</i> and <i>Klossia</i> a precocious association of the gametocytes precedes the true
copulation of the ripe gametes.</p></div>

<p>The classification of the Coccidiidea is based chiefly on the
number of sporozoites found in each spore, and the number of
sporocysts (spores) found in one oÃ¶cyst. LÃ©ger<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> recognises two
great legions, the Eimeridea and the Adeleidea, the former comprising
the greater number of genera, including the genus of most economic
importance, <i>Eimeria</i>. It must be noted that, though a member of<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
this genus may be frequently referred to as <i>Coccidium</i>, strictly it
should be termed <i>Eimeria</i>, that name having priority. The name
of the disease resulting from the action of such parasites is, however,
established and remains as coccidiosis.</p>

<p>Certain of the more important of the Coccidiidea may now be
considered.</p>


<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Eimeria</b>, AimÃ© Schneider, 1875.</p>

<p class="synj">Syn.: <i>Psorospermium</i>, Rivolta, 1878; <i>Cytospermium</i>, Rivolta, 1878; <i>Coccidium</i>,
R. Leuckart, 1879; <i>Pfeifferia</i>, LabbÃ©, 1894; <i>Pfeifferella</i>, LabbÃ©, 1899.</p>

<p>The Eimeria belong to LÃ©gerâs old family, the TetrasporocystidÃ¦,
which comprises forms producing oÃ¶cysts with four sporocysts, each
containing two sporozoites. The cysts are spherical or oval, as are
also usually the schizonts. The members of the genus are confined
chiefly to vertebrate hosts, the more important economically occurring
in mammals and birds. From the mammalian hosts very rarely the
parasites may reach man. <i>Eimeria</i> (<i>Coccidium</i>) <i>avium</i> of wild birds
and poultry, and <i>Eimeria stiedÃ¦</i> parasitic in rabbits, may be considered.
There is a general similarity in their life-cycles and each is
of great practical importance.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Eimeria avium</b>, Silvestrini and Rivolta.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Eimeria avium</i> is responsible for fatal epizoÃ¶tics among game birds such as
grouse, pheasants and partridges, and domestic poultry such as fowls, ducks, pigeons
and turkeys, and can pass from any one of these hosts to any of the others with the
same effect. The organism is parasitic in the alimentary tract of the host, affecting
more especially the small intestine (duodenum) and the cÃ¦ca, but in some cases
penetrating to the liver and multiplying there (as in turkeys), producing necrotic
cheesy patches, that ultimately become full of oÃ¶cysts. The gut is rendered very
frail by the action of the parasites, its mucous membrane is greatly injured, and
is often reduced to an almost structureless pulp, riddled with parasites (fig.&nbsp;68).
Infection is conveyed from host to host by the ingestion of food or drink contaminated
with the oÃ¶cysts voided in the fÃ¦ces of infected birds. Oval oÃ¶cysts from 24&nbsp;Âµ to
35&nbsp;Âµ long and from 14&nbsp;Âµ to 20&nbsp;Âµ broad are the means of infection. The oÃ¶cysts
develop internally four sporocysts or spores, from each of which two sporozoites are
produced. The life-history<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> presents two phases: (1) The asexual multiplicative
phase, schizogony, for the increase in numbers of the parasites within the same host;
(2) the reproductive phase, following the formation of gametes (gametogony), leading
to the production of resistant oÃ¶cysts, destined for the transference of the parasite
to new hosts (sporogony).</p>

<p>The oÃ¶cysts usually reach the duodenum unharmed, with food or drink. Under<span class="pagenum" title="143"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
the influence of the powerful digestive juices (especially the pancreatic) now encountered,
the oÃ¶cysts soften, as do the sporocysts, and ultimately two sporozoites
emerge from each sporocyst. The sporozoites are from 7&nbsp;Âµ to 10&nbsp;Âµ long, and each is
vermicular with a uniform nucleus (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_69">69</a>, <span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>). After a short period of active movement
in the gut, each sporozoite penetrates an epithelial cell (figs.&nbsp;68 <i>spz</i>, 69, <span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>), and
once within, gradually becomes rounded (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">C</span>). It grows rapidly, feeding on
the contents of the host cell and living as a trophozoite (fig.&nbsp;69, <i>D</i>). When the parasite
is from 10&nbsp;Âµ to 12&nbsp;Âµ in diameter, usually multiplication by schizogony (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">E</span>-<span class="lowercase smcap">H</span>)
begins. The nucleus of the parent cell, now called a schizont, divides into a number
of portions that become arranged at the periphery (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">E</span>). Cytoplasm collects
around each nucleus (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">E</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">F</span>) and gradually a group of daughter individuals
(merozoites) is produced (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">G</span>), the nucleus of each merozoite showing a
karyosome.</p></div>

<p>After a number of generations of merozoites have been formed, a limit is reached
both to the multiplicative capacity of the parasite and to the power of the bird
to provide the invader with food. Consequently, resistant forms of the parasite
are necessary, and the trophozoites begin to show sexual differentiation instead
of forming schizonts, that is, gametogony commences.</p>

<p>Certain trophozoites store food and become large and granular. These are
macrogametocytes (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">I</span>, â). The microgametocytes (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">I</span>, â) are
smaller and far less granular. The macrogametocyte continues to grow, and<span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>
becomes loaded with chromatoid and plastinoid granules (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">J</span>, â), while
the microgametocyte has its nucleus divide to form a number of bent, rod-like
portions (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">J</span>, â). The macrogametocyte gives rise to a single macrogamete,
which forms a cyst wall for itself, leaving a thin spot (micropyle) for the entry
of the male (fig 69, <span class="lowercase smcap">K</span>, â). The microgametocyte gives rise to numerous small,
biflagellate microgametes (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">K</span>, â) around a large, central residual mass,
from which they ultimately break free, and swim away. When a macrogamete
is reached, the microgamete enters through the micropyle (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">L</span>)&mdash;which
then closes, thus excluding the other males&mdash;and applies itself to the female
nucleus (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">M</span>). Nuclear fusion occurs, the oÃ¶cyst (encysted zygote) being thus
produced. Sporogony then ensues. The oÃ¶cyst (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">N</span>) at first has its contents
completely filling it. They then concentrate into a central spherical mass (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">O</span>)
which gradually becomes tetranucleate (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">P</span>). Cytoplasm collects around each
nucleus, and four sporoblasts are thus formed (fig.&nbsp;69, Q). Each sporoblast becomes
oval (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">R</span>) and produces a sporocyst. Ultimately two sporozoites are formed in
each sporocyst or spore, at first lying tÃªte-bÃªche (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">S</span>), but finally twisting
to assume the position most convenient for emergence (fig.&nbsp;69, <span class="lowercase smcap">T</span>) when they reach a
new host. The period of the life-cycle of <i>Eimeria avium</i> (as well as the details<span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>
of the life-cycle) was determined by Fantham to be from eight to ten days, of which
period schizogony occupies four to five days.</p>

<p>The method of infection<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> is contaminative, by way of food or drink. Young
birds are especially susceptible to infection. Certain birds, particularly older ones,
may act as reservoirs of oÃ¶cysts, being continuously infected themselves, without
showing any marked ill effects from the parasite, but being highly infectious
to other birds. Much moisture retards the development of sporocysts considerably.
The duration of vitality of the infective oÃ¶cysts has been determined
experimentally to extend well over two years, and in certain cases longer.
<i>Eimeria avium</i> is the causal agent of âwhite diarrhÅaâ or âwhite scourâ in
fowls, and of âblackheadâ in turkeys.</p></div>

<p><i>Eimeria avium</i> of birds and <i>E. stiedÃ¦</i> of rabbits closely resemble

<p><i>Eimeria stiedÃ¦</i> is parasitic in the gut epithelium (fig.&nbsp;70), liver, and
epithelium of the bile ducts of rabbits, and is usually considered to
be the parasite very occasionally found in man. The life-cycle
resembles that of <i>Eimeria avium</i> in its general outlines (see fig.&nbsp;69)
and therefore will not be detailed in full here. The oÃ¶cysts (fig.&nbsp;71)
are large, elongate-oval, greenish in fresh preparations and vary in
size from 24&nbsp;Âµ to 49&nbsp;Âµ long and 12Â·8&nbsp;Âµ to 28&nbsp;Âµ broad, the gut forms
being usually smaller than those occurring in the liver, owing to the<span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>
more confined space in which they are formed. Formerly, the parasites
in the liver were described under the name of <i>Coccidium oviforme</i>,
while those from the intestine were termed <i>Coccidium perforans</i>. This
distinction has now broken down.</p>

</div>

<p>The oÃ¶cysts<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> are thick-walled, somewhat flattened at one pole,
where a large micropyle is present. Four egg-shaped spores (sporocysts)
are formed within, each about 12&nbsp;Âµ to 15&nbsp;Âµ long and 7&nbsp;Âµ broad
(fig.&nbsp;72). The oÃ¶cysts are voided with the fÃ¦ces. Sporogony takes,
in nature, about three days in the excrement. FÃ¦cal contamination
of the food of rabbits results, and coccidian oÃ¶cysts are swallowed.
Under the influence of the pancreatic juice of a new host, the
sporozoites (fig.&nbsp;72, <i>a</i>&mdash;<i>c</i>) are liberated from the spores and proceed
to attack the epithelium and multiply within it, as in the case of
<i>Eimeria avium</i>. From the gut,
infection spreads to the liver,
where multiplication of the parasite
goes on actively, resulting
in the formation of the whitish
coccidial nodules, which may be
very conspicuous (fig.&nbsp;74). Proliferation
of the connective tissue
may occur around the coccidial
nodules, which then contain large
numbers of oÃ¶cysts in various
stages of development. It is said that the oÃ¶cysts in the older nodules
do not seem to be capable of further development. Schizogony (fig.&nbsp;73)
and gametogony in all stages can be found in both liver and gut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span></p>

<p>Young rabbits often die of intestinal coccidiosis before infection
of the liver occurs. The repeated schizogony of <i>Eimeria stiedÃ¦</i> in the
gut is sufficient to cause death.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The disease of cattle popularly known as âred dysenteryâ is also ascribed to the
action of <i>Eimeria stiedÃ¦</i>. The fÃ¦ces of infected cattle show blood clots of various
sizes and in severe cases watery diarrhÅa is present. Acute cases end fatally in
about two days. Numerous oÃ¶cysts, considered to be those of <i>Eimeria stiedÃ¦</i>, occur
in the fÃ¦ces, and there is a heavy infection of the gut, especially the large intestine
and rectum, all stages of the parasite being found in the epithelium. It is
suspected that cattle contract the disease by feeding on fresh grass contaminated
with oÃ¶cysts. The disease is recorded from Switzerland and from East Africa.</p></div>

<p class="spec">(<i>a</i>) <b>Human Hepatic Coccidiosis.</b></p>

<p>(1) Gublerâs Case. A stone-breaker, aged 45, was admitted to a Paris hospital
suffering from digestive disturbances and severe anÃ¦mia. On examination the liver
was found to be enlarged and presented a prominent swelling, which was regarded as
being due to Echinococcus. At the autopsy of the man, who succumbed to intercurrent
peritonitis, twenty cysts were found averaging 2 to 3&nbsp;cm. in diameter, and one
measuring 12 to 15&nbsp;cm. The caseous contents consisted of detritus, pus corpuscles,
and oval-shelled formations, which were considered to be Distoma eggs, but which,
in accordance with Leuckartâs conjecture, proved to be Coccidia.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>(2) Dresslerâs Case (Prague). Relates to three cysts, varying from the size of
a hemp-seed to that of a pea, and containing Coccidia, found in a manâs liver.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

serious symptoms, exhibited fever, enlarged liver and spleen, and had a dry, coated
tongue. At the autopsy numerous caseous centres, mostly immediately beneath the
surface, were found, while the contiguous parts of the liver were inflamed. Microscopical
examination demonstrated numerous Coccidia in the hepatic cells as well
as in the epithelium of the biliary ducts. A deposit of Coccidia was likewise found
in the spleen, which the parasites had probably reached by means of the blood-stream.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

epithelium of the intestine permeated by Coccidia. Railliet and Lucetâs case may
be traced back to intestinal Coccidia, which were found in the fÃ¦ces of a woman

enclosing a number of round substances. Virchow considered these foreign bodies
to be eggs of pentastomes in various stages of development, others consider them
to be Coccidia.</p>

<p>The Coccidia which Podwyssotzki claims to have seen in the liver of a man, not

<p>This parasite lives in the intestinal villi of dogs, cats, and the
polecat (<i>Mustela putorius</i>, L.). According to Stiles,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> the oÃ¶cyst
divides into two equal ellipsoidal portions or sporoblasts which
become spores and then each forms four sporozoites. The oÃ¶cysts
of this species vary from 22&nbsp;Âµ to 40&nbsp;Âµ in length and from 19&nbsp;Âµ to
28&nbsp;Âµ in breadth. Each spore is 10&nbsp;Âµ to 18&nbsp;Âµ long and contains
four sporozoites. The parasites live and multiply, not only in the
gut epithelium, but also in the connective tissue of the intestinal
submucosa. Wasielewski has seen merozoites in the gut of the cat.</p>

<p><i>Isospora bigemina</i> (fig.&nbsp;75) appears to occur also in man, for
Virchow published a case which was communicated to him by

<p>In literature many other statements are found as to the occurrence of
Coccidia-like organisms in different diseases of man. In some of the cases the
parasites proved to be fungi. This was the case with the parasites of a severe
skin disease of man, formerly called <i>Coccidioides immitis</i> and <i>Coccidioides pyogenes</i>.
Other statements are founded on misapprehensions, or are still much disputed.
If reference is here made to â<i>Eimeria hominis</i>,â R. Blanchard, 1895, this
is done on the authority of the investigator mentioned. The structures in
question are nucleated spindle-shaped bodies of very different lengths (18&nbsp;Âµ
to 100&nbsp;Âµ), which either occurred isolated or were enclosed in large globular or
oval cysts, alone or with a larger tuberculated body (âresidual bodyâ). These
formations were found by J. KÃ¼nstler and A. Pitres in the pleural exudation removed
from a man by tapping. The man was employed on the ships plying between
Bordeaux and the Senegal River.</p>

<p>Blanchard looks upon the fusiform bodies as merozoites and the cysts as
schizonts of a Coccidium. On the other hand, Moniez declares the spindle bodies
to be the ova and the supposed residual bodies to be âfloating ovariesâ of an
Echinorhynchus.</p>

<p>Severiâs âmonocystid Gregarines,â which were taken from the lung tissue of a
still-born child, are also quite problematical.</p>

<p>No less doubtful are the bodies which Perroncito calls <i>Coccidium jalinum</i>, and
which he found in severe diseases of the intestine in human beings, pigs, and guinea-pigs;
Borini also reported another case.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span></p>


<p class="spec">Order. <b>HÃ¦mosporidia</b>, Danilewsky emend. Schaudinn.</p>

<p>The HÃ¦mosporidia are a group of blood parasites, comprising
forms differing greatly among themselves. Some of the forms need
much further investigation. However, there are certain true HÃ¦mosporidia
which present close affinities with the Coccidia, leading
Doflein to use the term <b>Coccidiomorpha</b> for the two orders conjoined.</p>

<p>The HÃ¦mosporidia present the following general <span class="nowrap">characteristics:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) They are parasites of either red or white blood corpuscles of
vertebrates during one period of their life-history.</p>

<p>(2) They exhibit alternation of generations&mdash;asexual phases or
schizogony alternating with sexual phases or sporogony&mdash;as do the
Coccidia.</p>

<p>(3) There is also an alternation of hosts in those cases which have
so far been completely investigated. The schizogony occurs in the
blood or internal organs of some vertebrates while the sporogony
occurs in an invertebrate, such as a blood-sucking arthropod or leech.</p>

<p>(4) Unlike the Coccidia, resistant spores in sporocysts are not
generally produced, such protective phases in the life-cycle being
unnecessary, as the HÃ¦mosporidia are contained within either the
vertebrate or invertebrate host during the whole of their life.</p>

<p>The HÃ¦mosporidia may be considered for convenience under
five main <span class="nowrap">types:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) The <i>Plasmodium</i> or <i>HÃ¦mamÅba</i> type. This includes the
malarial parasites of man and of birds. The asexual multiplicative
or schizogonic phases occur inside red blood corpuscles and are
amÅboid. They produce distinctive, darkish pigment termed melanin
or hÃ¦mozoin. Infected blood drawn and cooled on a slide may
exhibit âexflagellationâ of the male gametocytes, <i>i.e.</i>, the formation
of filamentous male gametes. The invertebrate host is a mosquito.
The malarial parasites of man are discussed at length on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_155">155</a>.
Similar pigmented hÃ¦mamÅboid parasites have been described in
antelopes, dogs, and other mammals, and even reptiles.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>Halteridium</i> type. The trophozoite stage inside the red
blood corpuscle is halter-shaped. Pigment is produced, especially near
the ends of the organism. The parasites occur in the blood of birds.
The invertebrate host of <i>H. columbÃ¦</i> of pigeons in Europe, Africa,
Brazil and India, is a hippoboscid fly, belonging to the genus <i>Lynchia</i>.</p>

<p>Halteridium parasites are common in the blood of passerine birds,
such as pigeons, finches, stone owls, Java sparrows, parrots, etc.
The Halteridium embraces or grows around the nucleus of the host
red cell without displacing the nucleus. Young forms and multiplicative
stages of <i>H. columbÃ¦</i> have been found in leucocytes in the
lungs of the pigeon (fig.&nbsp;76, <i>8</i>-<i>12</i>). Male and female forms (gametocytes)
are seen in the blood (fig.&nbsp;76, <i>3a</i>, <i>3b</i>). The cytoplasm of the<span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>
male gametocytes is pale-staining and the nucleus is elongate, while
the cytoplasm of the females is darker and the nucleus is smaller
and round. Formation of male gametes from male gametocytes
(the so-called process of âexflagellationâ) may occur on a slide
of drawn infected blood, also fertilization, and formation of the
oÃ¶kinete, as first seen by MacCallum. The correct generic name for
Halteridia is, apparently, <i>HÃ¦moproteus</i>. Wasielewski (1913), working
on <i>H. danilewskyi</i> (var. <i>falconis</i>), in kestrels, finds that the halteridium
may be pathogenic to nestlings. The cycle of <i>H. noctuÃ¦</i>
described by Schaudinn (1904) lacks confirmation. The account of
the life-cycle of <i>H. columbÃ¦</i> given by AragÃ£o (1908) is illustrated in

occur within mononuclear leucocytes and young red cells (erythro<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>blasts)
in the blood of birds. Laveran and FranÃ§a consider that
the Leucocytozoa occur in erythrocytes. The host cells are often
greatly altered by the parasites, becoming hypertrophied and the ends
usually drawn into horn-like processes (fig.&nbsp;77), though some remain
rounded. Leucocytozoa are limited to birds, and very rarely produce
pigment. Male and female forms (gametocytes) are distinguishable
in the blood (fig.&nbsp;77), and the formation of male gametes (âexflagellationâ)
may occur in drawn blood.</p>

</div>

<p>The Leucocytozoa were first seen by Danilewsky in 1884. They
are usually oval or spherical. It is not easy sometimes to distinguish
the altered host cell from the parasite, as the nucleus of the former
is pushed to one side by the
leucocytozoÃ¶n. The cytoplasm
of the female parasite
stains deeply, and the nucleus
is rather small, containing a
karyosome. In the male the
cytoplasm stains lightly and
the nucleus is larger, with a
loose, granular structure.</p>

<p>Many species of Leucocytozoa
are recorded, but
schizogony has only been
described by Fantham (1910)<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>
in <i>L. lovati</i> in the spleen of
the grouse (<i>Lagopus scoticus</i>),
and by Moldovan<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> (1913) in
<i>L. ziemanni</i> in the internal
organs of screech-owls.</p>

<p>M. and A. Leger<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> (1914)
propose to classify Leucocytozoa,
provisionally, according as the host cells are fusiform or
rounded.</p>

<p>(4) The <i>HÃ¦mogregarina</i> type. Included herein are many parasites
of red blood corpuscles, with a few (the leucocytogregarines) parasitic
in the white cells of certain mammals and a few birds. They are not
amÅboid but gregarine-like, vermicular or sausage-shaped (fig.&nbsp;78).
They do not produce pigment. They are widely distributed among
the vertebrata, but are most numerous in cold-blooded vertebrates
(fishes, amphibia and reptiles). The hÃ¦mogregarines of aquatic hosts
are transmitted by leeches, those of terrestrial hosts by arthropods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span></p>

<p>The nucleus of hÃ¦mogregarines is usually near the middle of the
parasite, but may be situated nearer one end. The body of the
parasite may be lodged in a capsule (âcytocystâ). There is much
variation in size and appearance among hÃ¦mogregarines. Some are
small (<i>Lankesterella</i>); some attack the nucleus of the host cell (<i>Karyolysus</i>);
others have full grown vermicules larger than the containing
host corpuscle, and so the hÃ¦mogregarines bend on themselves in
the form of <b>U</b> (fig.&nbsp;78, <i>b</i>). Schizogony often occurs in the internal
organs of the host, sometimes in the circulating blood.</p>

<p>The hÃ¦mogregarines occurring in the white cells (mononuclears
or polymorphonuclears) of mammals have been referred to a separate
genus, <i>Leucocytogregarina</i> (Porter) or <i>HepatozoÃ¶n</i> (Miller). Such
leucocytogregarines are known in the dog (fig.&nbsp;79), rat, mouse, palm-squirrel,
rabbit, cat, etc. Schizogony of these forms occurs in the
internal organs, such as the liver, lung and bone-marrow of the hosts.
They are apparently transmitted by ectoparasitic arthropods, such as
ticks, mites, and lice.</p>

<p>A few hÃ¦mogregarines are known to be parasitic in the red blood
corpuscles of mammals. Such are <i>H. gerbilli</i> in the Indian field rat,
<i>Gerbillus indicus</i>; <i>H. balfouri</i> (<i>jaculi</i>) in the jerboa, <i>Jaculus jaculus</i>,
and a few species briefly described from marsupials. These parasites
do not form pigment.</p>

<p>Strict leucocytic gregarines have been described from a few birds
by AragÃ£o and by Todd.</p>

<p>The sporogony of hÃ¦mogregarines is only known in a few cases,
and in those affinity with the Coccidia is exhibited. In fact, the
HÃ¦mogregarines are now classified by some authors with the
Coccidia.</p>

<p class="ph1">THE MALARIAL PARASITES OF MAN.</p>

<p>Malaria, otherwise known as febris intermittens, chill-fever, ague,
marsh fever, paludism, etc., is the name given to a disease of man,
which begins with fever. It has been known since ancient times and
is distributed over almost all the world, although very unevenly, but
does not occur in waterless deserts and the Polar regions. In many
places, especially in the civilized countries of Central Europe, the
disease is extinct or occurs only sporadically, and large tracts of land
have become free from malaria.</p>

<p>The rhythmical course of the fever is characteristic. It begins
apparently suddenly with chilliness or typical shivering, whilst the
temperature of the body rises, the pulse becomes low and tense and
the number of beats of the pulse increases considerably. After half
to two hours the heat stage begins. The patient himself feels the rise
of his temperature (shown by feeling of heat, dry tongue, headache,<span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
thirst). The temperature may reach 41Â°C or more. At the same time
there is sensitiveness in the region of the spleen and enlargement of
that organ. After four to six hours an improvement takes place, and
with profuse perspiration the body temperature falls rapidly, not
often below normal. After the attack the patient feels languid, but
otherwise well until certain prodromal symptoms (heaviness in the
body, headache) which were not noticed at first, denote the approach
of another attack of fever, which proceeds in the same way.</p>

<p>The intervals between the attacks are of varying length which
permit of a distinction in the kinds of fever. If the attacks intermit
one day, occurring on the first, third and fifth days of the illness
and always at the same time of day, it is termed <i>febris tertiana</i>; if
two days occur between fever days, it is called <i>febris quartana</i>. In
the case of the fever recurring daily, later writers speak of typical
<i>febris quotidiana</i>. But a quotidian fever may arise when two tertian
fevers differing by about twenty-four hours exist at the same time
(<i>febris tertiana duplex</i>). The patient has a daily attack, but the fever
of the first, third and fifth days differs in some point (hour of
occurrence, height of temperature, duration of cold or hot stage)
from the fever of the second, fourth and sixth days. Similarly,
two or three quartan fevers which differ by about twenty-four hours
each may be observed together (<i>febris quartana duplex</i> or <i>triplex</i>);
in the latter case the result is also a quotidian fever.</p>

<p>Two kinds of tertian fever are differentiated&mdash;a milder form
occurring especially in the spring (spring tertian fever), and a more
severe form appearing in the summer and autumn in warmer
districts, especially in the tropics (<i>summer or autumn fever</i>, <i>febris
Ã¦stivo-autumnalis</i>, <i>febris tropica</i>, <i>febris perniciosa</i>). The latter often
becomes a quotidian fever.</p>

<p>All the afore-mentioned infections are termed acute. They are
distinguished from the very different <i>chronic malarial infection</i> by the
frequent occurrence of relapses, which finally lead to changes of
some organs and particularly of the blood. The relapses are then
generally marked by an irregular course of fever.</p>

<p>The term masked malaria is used when any disturbance of the state
of health of a periodic character shows itself and disappears after
treatment with quinine.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> Generally it is a question of neuralgia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That intermittent fever was an infectious disease, although not one which was
transmitted direct from man to man, had been assumed for a long time. Therefore
it was natural, at a time when bacteriology was triumphing, to look for a living agent
causing infection in malaria, which search was, seemingly, successful (Klebs,
Tomasi-Crudeli, 1879). Hence it was not surprising that the discovery of the<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
real malarial parasites in November, 1880, by the military doctor A. Laveran<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> in
Constantine (Algeria), at first met with violent opposition, even after Richard
(1882) had confirmed it and Marchiafava, Celli, Grassi and others, had
further extended it. Not that the existence of structures found in the blood of
malaria patients by Laveran and Richard was denied; on the contrary, the investigations
of the opponents furnished many valuable discoveries, but the organisms were
differently interpreted and considered to be degeneration products of red blood corpuscles.
Only when Marchiafava and Celli (1885) saw movements in the parasites,
which Laveran called <i>Oscillaria malariÃ¦</i> and later <i>HÃ¦matozoÃ¶n malariÃ¦</i>, was their
animal nature admitted and the parasites were named <i>Plasmodium malariÃ¦</i>. Shortly
before this, Gerhardt (1884) had stated that the disease could be transmitted by the
injection of the blood of a malarial patient to a healthy person.</p>

<p>This supplied the starting point for further investigations, which were made not
exclusively, but principally, by Italian investigators (Golgi, Marchiafava and Celli,
Bignami and Bastianelli, Grassi and Feletti, Mannaberg, Romanowsky, Osier,
Thayer and others). In 1885 Golgi described the asexual cycle in the blood,
in the case of the quartan parasite. These investigations, after attention had been
drawn by Danilewsky (1890) to the occurrence of similar endoglobular parasites in
birds, were extended to the latter (Grassi and Feletti, Celli and Sanfelice, Kruse,
LabbÃ© and others).</p>

<p>The result was as follows: Malaria in man (and birds) is the result of peculiar
parasites included in the <i>Sporozoa</i> by Metchnikoff, which parasites live in the erythrocytes,
grow in size and finally âsporulate,â that is, separate into a number of âsporesâ
which leave the erythrocytes and infect other blood corpuscles. Morphologically and
biologically several species (and respectively several varieties) of malarial parasites
may be distinguished, on which the different intermittent forms depend. Transmission
of the blood of patients to healthy people produces a malarial affection which
corresponds in character to the fever of the patient from whom the inoculation was
made. The combined types of fever (tertiana duplex, quartana duplex or triplex)
are explained by the fact that the patient harbours two or three groups of parasites
which differ in their development by about twenty-four hours, whilst the irregular fevers
depend on deviation from the typical course of development of the parasites. In
addition to stages of the parasites which could easily be arranged in a developmental
series concurrent with the course of the disease, other phases of the parasites also
became known, such as spheres, crescents, polymitus forms, which seemed not to be
included in the series and, therefore, were very differently interpreted.</p>

<p>The decision reached at the beginning of the last decade of the last century, which
found expression in comprehensive statements (Mannaberg, Ziemann and others),
only concerned a part of the complete development of the malarial parasites. No one
could with any degree of certainty demonstrate how man became infected, nor were
there reliable hypotheses based on analogy with other parasites concerning the exit
of the excitants of malaria from the infected person and their further behaviour.
Numerous hypotheses had been advanced, but none was able to elucidate the<span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>
various observations made from time to time in dealing with malaria. One hypothesis
only seemed to have a better foundation. Manson (1894), who knew from his
own experience the part played by mosquitoes in the development of Filaria from
the blood of man, applied this also to the malarial parasites living in the blood,
whereby at least the way was indicated by which the HÃ¦mosporidia could leave man.
The parasites were said finally to get into water through mosquitoes which had
sucked the blood of malarial patients, and the germ spread thence to men who drank
the water. In some cases the parasites were supposed to reach man by the inhaling of
the dust of dried marshes. On the other hand, Bignami believed that the mosquitoes
were infected in the open air by malarial parasites which occurred there in an unknown
stage and the insects transmitted the germs to man when biting. R. Koch combined
both hypotheses, without, however, producing positive proof. R. Ross, then (1897â8)
an English military doctor in India, was the first to succeed in this. He had been
encouraged by Manson to study the fate of malarial <i>Plasmodia</i> which had entered
the intestine of mosquitoes with malaria-infected blood, especially in the case of the
<i>Plasmodium</i> (<i>Proteosoma</i>) living in the blood of birds. He showed that the <i>Proteosoma</i>
penetrate the intestinal wall of the mosquitoes, grow and develop into large
cysts which produce innumerable rod-like germs, which burst into the body cavity
and penetrate the salivary glands. Ross allowed mosquitoes to suck the blood of
birds affected by malaria, and some nine days later, let the infected mosquitoes
which had been isolated suck healthy birds. After five to nine days <i>Proteosoma</i>
were found to occur in the blood of the birds used. The <i>Proteosoma</i> and <i>Halteridium</i>
of birds were also further investigated by MacCallum (1897â8), Koch and others, and
important results followed.</p>

<p>In any case Ross (1898) had clearly established the importance of mosquitoes in
the spread of malaria among birds. It was now only a question of proving whether,
and how far, mosquitoes were concerned with human malaria. Ross himself worked
to this end. Here the experiments of Italian investigators (Bignami, Bastianelli,
Grassi)<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> were of importance. These investigators studied the fate of malarial
parasites in man, produced malaria in men experimentally by the bites of infected
mosquitoes, and established that only mosquitoes belonging to the genus <i>Anopheles</i>
were concerned, and not species of <i>Culex</i>. These latter are only able to transmit
<i>Proteosoma</i> to birds. It is true that <i>Culex</i> can ingest the human malarial parasites,
but the latter do not develop in them. Development only occurs in species of
<i>Anopheles</i>. In <i>Anopheles</i> (and similarly for <i>Proteosoma</i> in <i>Culex</i>) sexual reproduction
takes place; crescents, spheres and polymitus forms are necessary stages
of development in the mosquito.</p>

<p>With these discoveries the campaign against malaria became more definite. It
was directed partly against the transmitters, whose biology and life-cycle were more
thoroughly investigated, instead of merely against the infection of the adult <i>Anopheles</i>.
The latter do not, as was believed for some time, transmit the malarial germs to their
offspring. They always infect themselves from human beings, whereby the relapses
appearing in early summer, and the latent infection, especially of children of natives,
play a principal part (Stephens and Christophers, Koch). Further, the crusade was
directed against the infection of man by the bites of <i>Anopheles</i>. Important results
have been obtained in these directions. Low and Sambon in 1900 lived in a
mosquito-screened hut in a malarial part of the Roman Campagna for three of the
most malarious months and did not contract the disease. In the same year Dr. P.&nbsp;T.
Manson was infected with malaria by infected mosquitoes sent from Italy. The rÃ´le
of mosquitoes having been proved, it may be hoped that ultimately the eradication
of malaria, or at least a considerable restriction of it, will be achieved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span></p>

<p>It is of importance to record that, although malarial parasites occur in mammals
(monkeys, bats, etc.) the human ones are not transmissible to mammals, not even to
monkeys. The species, therefore, are specific to the different hosts (Dionisi, Kossel,
Ziemann, Vassall).</p>

<p>An important work dealing with the modern applications of the mosquito-malaria
theory in all parts of the Tropics was published by Sir Ronald Ross in 1911. It is
entitled âThe Prevention of Malariaâ (John Murray, London, 21s.).</p></div>


<p class="ph1">DEVELOPMENT OF THE MALARIAL PARASITES OF MAN.</p>

<p>The commencement of the developmental cycle and of the infection
of man, is the sporozoites (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_80">80</a>, <i>1</i>) which are passed into the blood
of a person by the bite of an infected mosquito. Prior to this the parasites
collect in the excretory ducts of the salivary glands (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>27</i>)
of the <i>Anopheles</i>. The sporozoites are elongate and spindle-shaped,
10&nbsp;Âµ to 20&nbsp;Âµ long and 1&nbsp;Âµ to 2&nbsp;Âµ broad, with an oval nucleus situated
in the middle. They are able to glide, perform peristaltic contractions,
or curve laterally. Schaudinn has studied the penetration of the red
blood corpuscles (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>2</i>) by the sporozoites in the case of the
living tertian parasite. The process takes forty to sixty minutes in
drawn blood. After its entrance the parasite, which is now called a
trophozoite, contracts, and becomes an active amÅbula (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>3</i>).
It develops a food vacuole and grows at the expense of the invaded
blood corpuscle (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>4</i>), which is shown by the appearance of
pigment granules (transformed hÃ¦moglobin) in it. When the maximum
size is attained, multiplication by schizogony (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>5</i>-<i>7</i>) begins
with a division of the nucleus, which is followed by further divisions of
the daughter nuclei, the number of which varies up to 16 or even 32,
depending on the species of the parasite. Then the cytoplasm divides
into as many portions as there are nuclei, the result being a structure
suggestive of the spokes of a wheel or of a daisy, the centre of the
resulting rosette being occupied by dark pigment. Finally, the parts
separate from one another, leaving behind a residual body containing
the pigment, and the daughter forms issue into the blood plasma
as merozoites (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>7</i>). They are actively amÅboid (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>8</i>) and
soon begin to enter other blood corpuscles of their host, for the entry
into which thirty to sixty minutes are necessary, according to
Schaudinnâs observations.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>Here they behave like sporozoites which previously entered and<span class="pagenum" title="160"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span><span class="pagenum hide" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>
again produce merozoites. This process is repeated until the number
of parasites is so large that, at the next migration of the merozoites, the
body of the person infected reacts with an attack of fever,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> which is
repeated with the occurrence of the next or following generations.</p>

of man. If macrogametocytes (12<i>a</i>) do not get into the intestine of <i>Anopheles</i> they may perhaps
increase parthenogenetically according to Schaudinn (12<i>a</i>; 13<i>c</i>-17<i>c</i>). The merozoites which
have arisen (17<i>c</i>) become schizonts 3â7. The phases shown underneath the dotted line

20â25, stages of sporogony on the outer surface of the intestinal wall; 26, migration of the
sporozoites to the salivary gland; 27, salivary gland with sporozoites.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The growth and schizogony last different times, according to the
species of the parasite, about forty-eight hours in the case of the
parasite of febris tertiana or tropica, and seventy-two hours for the
quartan parasite. The various intermittent forms produced by them
depend on this specific difference in the malarial parasites.</p>

<p>The schizogony can, however, only be repeated a certain number
of times, supposing that the disease has not been checked prematurely
by the administration of quinine, which is able to kill the parasites.
It appears that after a number of attacks of fever the conditions of
existence in man are unfavourable for the malarial parasites, and this
brings about the production of other forms which have long been
known, but also long misunderstood (spheres, crescents, polymitus).
The merozoites in this case no longer grow into schizonts, or at least
not all of them, but become sexual individuals called gametocytes
(fig.&nbsp;80, <i>9</i>-<i>12</i>), which only start their further development when they
have reached the intestine of <i>Anopheles</i>. This does not take place
in every case, nor with all the gametocytes which exist in the blood of
patients with intermittent fever. Of those parasites which remain
in the human blood the male ones (microgametocytes) soon perish,
the females (macrogametocytes) persist for some long time, and perhaps
at last acquire the capacity of increasing by schizogony. They
might thus form merozoites which behave in the body as if they had
proceeded from ordinary schizonts (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>13c</i>-<i>17c</i>). If their
number increases sufficiently, in course of time the patient, who
was apparently recovering, has a new series of fever attacks, or
relapses, without there having been a new infection. This is the
view of Schaudinn, who from researches of his own concluded that
relapses were brought about by a sort of parthenogenetic reproduction
of macrogametocytes. R. Ross, on the contrary, believes that in the<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
relatively healthy periods the number of parasites in the blood falls
below that necessary to provoke febrile symptoms; relapses then
result merely from increase in the numbers of the parasites present in
the individual. Rossâs view is now generally accepted.</p>

<p>If the gametocytes, which are globular, or in the pernicious
or malignant tertian parasite crescentic (fig.&nbsp;81), gain access to the
intestine of an Anopheline,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> they mature. The macrogametocytes
extrude a part of their nuclear substance (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_80">80</a>, <i>13a</i>, <i>14a</i>) and
thereby become females or macrogametes. The microgametocytes, on
the other hand, undergo repeated nuclear division, preparation for
this being made apparently whilst in the blood of man. This results
in the formation of threadlike bodies which move like flagella and
finally detach themselves from the residual body (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>13b</i>, <i>14b</i>).
These are the males or microgametes<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>15b</i>).</p>

<p>Copulation takes place in the stomach of the Anopheline (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_80">80</a>, <i>16</i>).
A microgamete penetrates a macrogamete and coalesces with it. The<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
fertilized females elongate very soon and are called oÃ¶kinetes or
âvermiculesâ (figs.&nbsp;80, <i>17</i>; 82). They penetrate the walls of the
stomach, pierce the epithelium (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>18</i>, <i>19</i>), and remain lying
between it and the superficial stratum
(tunica elastico-muscularis). Then they
become rounded and gradually develop
into cysts which grow larger and are
finally visible to the naked eye, being
called oÃ¶cysts (figs.&nbsp;80, <i>20</i>-<i>24</i>; 83). Their
size at the beginning is about 5&nbsp;Âµ, the
maximum that they attain is 60&nbsp;Âµ, only
exceptionally are they larger.</p>

<p>The sporulation (figs.&nbsp;80, <i>21</i>-<i>25</i>; 84),
which now follows, begins with repeated
multiple fission of the nucleus. Long
before the definitive number of nuclei,
which varies with the individual, is attained
the protoplasm, according to Grassi, begins to segment around the
individual large nuclei but without separating completely into cell
areas. According to Schaudinn,
however, there is a condensation
of the outstanding protoplasmic
strands. It is certain that the number
of nuclei increases with simultaneous
decrease in size. They
soon appear on the surface of the
strands or sporoblasts, surround
themselves with some cytoplasm
and then elongate (fig.&nbsp;84). In
this manner the sporozoites are
formed and break away from the
unused remains of the cytoplasmic
strands of the sporoblasts
(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_80">80</a>, <i>26</i>). The number of the
sporozoites in an oÃ¶cyst varies from
several hundreds to ten thousand.</p>

temperature of 25Â° to 30Â°&nbsp;C. and takes
eight to nine days. A temperature a
few degrees lower has a retarding effect (eighteen to nineteen days at 18Â° to 20Â°&nbsp;C).
A still lower one has a restraining or even destructive effect. Temperatures over
35Â°&nbsp;C. also exercise a harmful effect. The malignant tertian parasite seems to need
a somewhat higher temperature and the quartan parasite a lower one.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span></p>

<p>The sporozoites of the various malarial parasites show no specific
differences. They were stated by Schaudinn to occur in three forms,
and these were described as indifferent (neuter), female and male.
There is, however, little or no evidence for this hypothetical differentiation.
The last were said to perish prematurely, that is, in the
oÃ¶cyst. The others after the rupture of the oÃ¶cysts enter the body
cavity of the Anophelines, whence they are carried along in the course
of the blood. Finally they penetrate the salivary glands (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>27</i>)
probably by their own activity, break through their epithelia and
accumulate in the salivary duct (fig.&nbsp;80, <i>27</i>). At the next bite by the
mosquito they are transmitted to the blood-vessels of man.</p>

<p>In view of the differences in opinion regarding âspeciesâ and âvarieties,â the dispute
whether the malarial parasites of man represent one species with several varieties, or several
species is almost superfluous. If necessary two genera may be distinguished.</p></div>

<p>The parasites of the tertian and quartan fever are alike in that
their gametocytes have a rounded shape (figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_80">80</a>, <i>12</i>, <i>13</i>), whilst the
corresponding stages of the pernicious or malignant tertian parasites
are crescentic (figs.&nbsp;81, <a href="#Fig_88">88</a>). These differences are used by some writers
as the distinguishing characteristic of two genera: <i>Plasmodium</i>, Marchiafava
and Celli, 1885, for the first mentioned species; <i>Laverania</i>,
Grassi and Feletti, 1889, for the pernicious or malignant tertian parasite.
Whether there is a genuine quotidian fever and accordingly a special
quotidian parasite is still disputed.</p>

<p>This species, <i>P. vivax</i>,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> is the causal agent of the simple or spring
tertian fever and is, therefore, named directly the tertian or benign
tertian parasite (figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_80">80</a>, <i>3</i>-<i>8</i>; 85). During the afebrile period in the
patient, the young trophozoites or amÅbulÃ¦ appear on or in the red
blood corpuscles as pale bodies of 1Â·5&nbsp;Âµ to 2&nbsp;Âµ diameter which at
first show only slow amÅboid movements. Their nucleus is difficult
to recognize in the early stage. Soon the food vacuole is formed and
this grows concomitantly with the trophozoite and the parasite has a
ring-like appearance. Afterwards the vacuole diminishes, and at this<span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>
period the first brownish melanin granule appears. From this time
the activity and number of the pigment granules increase with continuous
growth. When the parasite has grown to about one-third
the diameter of the erythrocyte the latter shows characteristic red
SchÃ¼ffnerâs dots or âfine stippling,â after staining with Romanowskyâs
solution. Later, after about twenty-four hours, the blood corpuscles
begin to grow pale, then to increase in size, and after thirty-six hours,
that is, about twelve hours before the next attack of fever, schizogony
of the parasite is initiated by the division of the nucleus. The parasite
at this time occupies half to two-thirds of the enlarged blood corpuscle.
The daughter nuclei continue dividing until sixteen, and
occasionally twenty-four, daughter nuclei are produced. The pigment
which, up till now lies nearer the periphery, moves to the middle,
while the nuclei lie nearer the surface.</p>

</div>

<p>Around each nucleus a portion of cytoplasm collects and thus
young merozoites are produced. These separate from each other and
from the little residual masses<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> which contain the melanin and pass
from the blood corpuscles, which now can hardly be recognized, to
the blood plasma, where they soon attack new erythrocytes.</p>

<p>The migration of the merozoites initiates a new attack of fever
and two groups of tertian parasites in the blood, differing in development
by about twenty-four hours, are the conditions for febris tertiana
duplex.</p>

<p>After a lengthy duration of fever the gametocytes (figs.&nbsp;80, <i>9</i>&mdash;<i>12</i>)
appear. They are uninucleate. The microgametocytes are about the
size of fully developed schizonts, the macrogametocytes are somewhat
larger. Their further development takes place in Anophelines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span></p>

<p>The chief distinctive characteristics of the simple tertian parasite,
as seen in infected blood, are:&mdash;(1) The infected red-cell is usually
enlarged; (2) the presence of fine red granules known as SchÃ¼ffnerâs
dots in the red blood corpuscles, after Romanowsky staining; (3)
the fragile appearance of the parasite compared with other species.
Large forms are pigmented, irregular and âflimsy-looking,â sometimes
appearing to consist of separate parts. Irregularity of contour
is common.</p>

<p><i>Plasmodium malariÃ¦</i> is the parasite of quartan malaria (fig.&nbsp;86).
The trophozoites of the quartan parasite differ from the corresponding
stages of the tertian parasite in that their motility is less and soon
ceases. They differ also in their slower growth, by the early
disappearance of the food vacuole, by the more marked formation
of the dark brown pigment, and by the fact that the red blood
corpuscles attacked are not altered either in colour or size.</p>

<p>When the parasites have grown almost to the size of the erythrocytes
schizogony occurs. The pigment granules arrange themselves in lines
radiating towards the centre and the merozoites are also radially
disposed in groups of 6, 8, 10 or even 12, but are often arranged
less regularly. The whole development, growth and schizogony,
occupies seventy-two hours.</p>

<p>The appearance of quartana duplex or triplex is conditional on the
presence in the blood of the patient of two or three groups of
<i>Plasmodia</i> differing in their development by twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The chief distinctive characters of the quartan parasite are: (1)
The erythrocyte is unchanged in size; (2) the rings are compact and
show pigment early; in the larger forms the chromatin is dense and
relatively plentiful; (3) the pigment, which is relatively well-marked,
may be arranged at the periphery.</p>

<p>The names most commonly used for the parasite of malignant
tertian malaria are <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and <i>Laverania malariÃ¦</i>.</p>

<p>The summer and autumn fever (<i>febris Ã¦stivo-autumnalis</i>), also
called malignant tertian or sub-tertian, is caused by a malarial parasite
which is distinguished by the small size of its schizont, while the
gametocytes are crescentic (figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_81">81</a>, 88).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Most authors identify this kind of fever or the parasites which cause it (<i>Laverania
malariÃ¦</i>) with the pernicious malaria of the tropics. Ziemann, however, repeatedly
has drawn attention to certain small but definite differences between the usual malignant
tertian or pernicious parasites which occur in the tropics and the tropical parasites
of some malarial districts, particularly of West Africa, and insists that at least two
varieties or sub-species occur. Other investigators distinguish from this or these
forms a quotidian parasite. On the other hand, the assertion is made that there are
no specific differences, but that the malignant or pernicious tertian parasite which
normally needs forty-eight hours for its development in the blood of man, can
also develop in twenty-four hours. The establishment of the duration of the
development is a matter of especial difficulty, because the stages of schizogony
are far less numerous in the peripheral blood than in that of the internal organs. It
is also stated that the tropical parasite very seldom forms crescentic but rather
rounded gametocytes. According to such an observation the organism would belong
to <i>Plasmodium</i> and not to <i>Laverania</i>. The question whether the tropical fevers are
caused by two different parasites does not seem to be definitely settled.</p></div>

<p>The young trophozoite of the malignant, pernicious tertian, or sub-tertian
parasite (fig.&nbsp;87) are but slightly active and are very small, even
after the formation of the comparatively large food vacuole, which
makes the body appear annular (âsignet ringâ stage). Often two and
even more parasites are found in one blood corpuscle.</p>

<p>Fully grown they only attain two-thirds or less of the diameter of
the erythrocytes, which display an inclination to shrink and then appear<span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>
darker than the normal (brass-coloured). In the early stage dots or
stippling&mdash;sometimes called Maurerâs dots&mdash;appear on the blood corpuscles
as in those attacked by the ordinary tertian parasite (<i>Plasmodium
vivax</i>), but the Maurerâs dots are relatively coarse and few, and
are not easily stained. These dots were first described by Stephens
and Christophers in 1900, and subsequently by Maurer in 1902.</p>

<p>About thirty hours after the entrance into the blood corpuscles,
the parasites are rarely found in the peripheral blood, but they are
present in the internal organs, and especially in the spleen. The
schizogony, which now begins in the internal organs, proceeds on the
same lines as that of the quartan parasite, that is, usually with the
merozoites radially arranged around a central agglomeration of dark
brown pigment.</p>

<p>The number of merozoites formed is quoted differently, <i>e.g.</i>, 8 to 24,
on an average 12 to 16. However, according to the recent cultural
researches of J.&nbsp;G. and D. Thomson<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> (1913) the number of merozoites
of <i>P. falciparum</i> is 32. D. Thomson, from examination of spleen
smears at autopsy, also concludes that the number of merozoites may
reach 32. During their formation the blood corpuscle which is
attacked gets paler and disintegrates.</p>

</div>

<p>The gametocytes which finally appear are attenuated, curved
bodies, rounded at each end and known as crescents (figs.&nbsp;81, 88), and
are provided with a nucleus and with coarse pigment masses. In the
males the pigment is more scattered than in the females, where it is
around the nucleus. Their length is 9&nbsp;Âµ to 14&nbsp;Âµ, and their breadth is<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
2&nbsp;Âµ to 3&nbsp;Âµ. At first they are still in the pale blood corpuscles, later
they free themselves and are found in numbers in the peripheral
blood in cases of pernicious malaria of Southern Europe and the
tropics, while, on the other hand, they occur much more rarely in
the peripheral blood in West African malignant tertian. Their further
development takes place under the same conditions as in the other
malarial parasites.</p>

<p>D. Thomson (1914),<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> from studies of autopsy smears, has shown
that crescents develop chiefly in the bone-marrow and spleen, and
take about ten days to grow into the adult state in the internal organs.
He believes that crescents are produced from ordinary asexual spores.
Quinine, he states, has no direct destructive action on crescents, but
it destroys the asexual source of supply.</p>

<p>The principal distinctive characters of the malignant tertian parasite
are: (1) The ring forms are very small, occasionally bacilliform,
and may be marginal (âaccolÃ©â of Laveran); (2) the larger trophozoites
are often ovoid, and about one-third or one-half of the
erythrocyte in size; (3) the infected red cells sometimes show coarse<span class="pagenum" title="170"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>
stippling (Maurerâs dots); (4) the gametocytes, or sexual forms, are
crescentic in shape.</p>

<p>J.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. Stephens (1914) has described a new malarial parasite of
man; it is called <i>Plasmodium tenue</i>. It is very amÅboid, with scanty
cytoplasm and much chromatin, sometimes rod-like or irregular.
The parasite was described from a blood-smear of an Indian child.
The creation of a new species for this parasite has been criticized by
Balfour and Wenyon, and by Craig.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>HÃ¦mamÅboid, pigment-producing, malarial parasites are often found in birds.
Like the human malarial parasites they have been variously named. LabbÃ© created
the genus <i>Proteosoma</i> for them, and this name is still often used as a distinctive one
unofficially. The correct name is stated to be either <i>Plasmodium relictum</i> or
<i>P. prÃ¦cox</i>, or possibly even <i>P. danilewskyi</i>, assuming that there is only one species.
The nomenclature of the malarial parasites is most confused. The avian malarial
parasites are transmitted by Culicine mosquitoes.</p>

<p>The organism was discovered by Grassi in the blood of birds in Italy, and causes
a fatal disease in partridges in Hungary. Sparrows are affected in India, and it
was this Plasmodium in which Ross first traced the development of a malarial
parasite in a mosquito. The parasite may be transmitted from bird to bird by
blood-inoculation, canaries being very susceptible.</p>

<p>The principal stages of the avian plasmodium closely resemble those of the
malarial parasites of man. In its earliest stage <i>P. relictum</i> is unpigmented,
but soon the trophozoite grows and becomes pigmented, meanwhile displacing
the nucleus of the avian red-blood corpuscle, a characteristic feature, distinguishing
it from <i>Halteridium</i>. Schizonts are formed, each of which gives rise to
about nine merozoites in the circulating blood. Sexual forms or gametocytes also
occur in the blood. These develop in <i>Culex fatigans</i>, <i>C. pipiens</i> and <i>C. nemorosus</i>.
OÃ¶kinetes or vermicules are formed in twelve to fifteen hours in the
stomach of the mosquito, and in one to two days well-developed round oÃ¶cysts may
be seen. In three to four days sporoblasts have formed within the oÃ¶cysts and
young sporozoites begin to develop. In nine to ten days the oÃ¶cysts are mature,
being filled with sporozoites. The oÃ¶cysts then burst and the sporozoites travel
through the thoracic muscles to the salivary glands of the Culicine.</p>

<p>Neumann, experimenting with canaries, found that <i>Stegomyia fasciata</i> could
transmit the infection, but less efficiently than species of <i>Culex</i>.</p></div>

<p>Essentially the method of cultivation, as used by Thomson,
is as follows: 10&nbsp;c.c. of infected blood are drawn from a vein and
transferred to a sterile test tube, in which is a thick wire leading to
the bottom of the tube. One-tenth of a cubic centimetre of a
50 per cent. aqueous solution of glucose or dextrose is placed
in the test tube, preferably before adding the blood. The blood
is defibrinated by stirring gently with the wire. When defibrination
is complete the wire and the clot are removed, and the glucose-blood
is transferred, in portions, to several smaller sterile tubes, each containing
a column of blood about one inch in height. The tubes
are plugged and capped and then transferred, standing upright, to an<span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>
incubator kept at a temperature of 37Â°&nbsp;C. to 41Â°&nbsp;C. The blood corpuscles
soon settle, leaving a column of serum at the top, to the extent
of about half an inch in each tube. The leucocytes need not be
removed by centrifugalization. J.&nbsp;G. Thomson (1913) and his
collaborators did not find it necessary to destroy the complement in
the serum, and they found that the malarial parasites developed at all
levels in the column of corpuscles, and not merely on the surface
layer of the corpuscles as first stated by Bass and Johns.</p>

<p>So far only the asexual generation of the malarial parasites has
been grown <i>in vitro</i>. Thomson rarely observed hÃ¦molysis in the
cultures. Clumping of the malignant tertian parasites occurred.
In cultures of the benign tertian parasite (<i>Plasmodium vivax</i>) clumping
was not observed. J.&nbsp;G. and D. Thomson consider that this
difference as regards clumping explains why only young forms of
malignant tertian are found in peripheral blood, as the clumping
tendency of the larger forms causes them to be arrested in the finer
capillaries of the internal organs. It also explains the tendency to
pernicious symptoms, such as coma, in malignant tertian malaria.
Further it was found from cultures that <i>P. falciparum</i> was capable
of producing thirty-two spores (merozoites) in maximum segmentation,
while <i>P. vivax</i> produced sixteen spores (merozoites) as a rule,
though the number might be greater than sixteen. (Quartan parasites
produce eight spores or merozoites in schizogony.)</p>

<p>It may also be mentioned here that <i>Babesia</i> (<i>Piroplasma</i>) <i>canis</i> has
been successfully cultivated <i>in vitro</i> by Bassâs method. This has been
accomplished by Thomson and Fantham,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> Ziemann, and Toyoda in
1913. J.&nbsp;G. Thomson and Fantham used the simplified Bass technique
recorded above, namely, infected blood and glucose, incubating at
37Â°&nbsp;C. In one of the <i>B. canis</i> cultures, starting with heart blood of a
dog containing corpuscles infected with one, two, or, exceptionally,
four piroplasmata, Thomson and Fantham succeeded in obtaining a
maximum of thirty-two merozoites in a corpuscle. The cultures are
infective to dogs and sub-cultures have been obtained.</p>


<p class="spec">Family. <b>PiroplasmidÃ¦</b>, FranÃ§a.</p>

<p>The parasites included in this provisional family or group belong
to the HÃ¦mosporidia. They are minute organisms, sometimes
amÅboid, but usually possessing a definite form. They are endoglobular,
being contained within mammalian red blood corpuscles,
but they produce no pigment. The true Piroplasmata, belonging
to the genus <i>Babesia</i>, destroy the host corpuscles, setting free the<span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>
hÃ¦moglobin, which is excreted by the kidneys of the cow, sheep,
horse, dog, etc., acting as host. The disease produced, variously called
piroplasmosis or babesiasis, is consequently characterized by a red
coloration of the urine known as hÃ¦moglobinuria, or popularly as
âred-water.â One of the best known piroplasms is <i>Piroplasma
bigeminum</i> or <i>Babesia bovis</i> (probably the latter name is correct),
which is the causal agent of âTexas feverâ or âred-waterâ in cattle
and is spread by ticks.</p>

<p>Of recent years, researches on the morphology of these blood
parasites has led to their separation into various genera and species.
However, our knowledge is still very far from complete. The various<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>

family, PiroplasmidÃ¦, may be listed, though further research may
lead to <span class="nowrap">emendations:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) <i>Babesia</i> (Starcovici) or <i>Piroplasma</i> (Patton). Pyriform
parasites, dividing by a special form of budding or gemmation with
chromatin forking, as well as by direct binary fission. Parasitic in
oxen, dogs, sheep, horses, etc.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Theileria</i> (Bettencourt, FranÃ§a and Borges). Rod-shaped and
oval parasites occurring in cattle and deer. <i>T. parva</i> is the pathogenic
agent of African East Coast fever in cattle.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Nuttallia</i> (FranÃ§a). Oval or pear-shaped parasites, with multiplication
in the form of a cross. <i>N. equi</i><a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> (fig.&nbsp;90) of equine âpiroplasmosisâ
(nuttalliosis). <i>N. herpestidis</i> in a mongoose.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Nicollia</i> (Nuttall). Oval or pear-shaped parasites with
characteristic nuclear dimorphism, and with quadruple division at
first fan-like, then like a four-leaved clover. <i>N. quadrigemina</i> from
the gondi.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Smithia</i> (FranÃ§a). Pear-shaped, single forms stretching across
the blood corpuscle. Multiplication into four in the form of a cross.
<i>S. microti</i> from <i>Microtus arvalis</i>, <i>S. talpÃ¦</i> from the mole.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Rossiella</i> (Nuttall). This belongs to the family PiroplasmidÃ¦
of FranÃ§a. It is intracorpuscular and non-pigment forming, occurring
singly, in pairs, or occasionally in fours. It is usually round and
larger than Babesia. The parasite multiplies by binary fission.
<i>R. rossi</i> in the jackal.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Babesia</i> is the best known and most important, and
will be considered next.</p>


<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Babesia</b>, Starcovici, 1893.</p>

<p class="synj">Syn.: <i>Pyrosoma</i>, Smith and Kilborne, 1893; <i>Apiosoma</i>, Wandolleck, 1895; <i>Piroplasma</i>,
W.&nbsp;H. Patton, 1895; <i>AmÅbosporidium</i>, Bonome, 1895.</p>

<p>The organisms belonging to this genus are pyriform, round or
amÅboid. The characteristic mode of division is as follows: Just
before division the parasite becomes amÅboid and irregular in shape,
(fig.&nbsp;91, <i>1â5</i>) with a compact nucleus. The latter gives off a nuclear
bud. This nuclear bud divides into two by forking (fig.&nbsp;91, <i>6</i>, <i>7</i>).
The chromatin forks grow towards the surface of the body of the
rounded parasite, and then two cytoplasmic buds grow out. The
forking nuclear buds, which are <b>Y</b>-shaped, pass into the cytoplasmic
outgrowths<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> (fig.&nbsp;91, <i>8</i>, <i>9</i>). The buds gradually increase in size at<span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span><span class="pagenum hide" title="176"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>
the expense of the parent form until they become two pear-shaped
parasites joined at their pointed ends. The connecting strand shrinks
and the two daughter forms separate (fig.&nbsp;91, <i>10â14</i>). The pyriform
parasites after having exhausted the blood corpuscle escape from it
(fig.&nbsp;91, <i>15</i>), and seek out fresh host corpuscles, entering by the rounded,
blunt end (fig.&nbsp;91, <i>1</i>). It is the pyriform phase of the parasite which
penetrates red blood corpuscles, not rounded forms, which die if set
free. The pyriform parasite, however, becomes rounded (fig.&nbsp;91, <i>2</i>, <i>3</i>),
soon after its entry into a fresh host cell. This interesting mode of
division by gemmation and chromatin forking has been made diagnostic
of the genus <i>Babesia</i> by Nuttall.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> Rounded forms of <i>Babesia</i>
divide by binary fission, and this direct method can also be adopted
by the other forms of Babesia.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The distribution of the chromatin in the pear-shaped <i>Babesia</i>, as seen in <i>B. canis</i>
and <i>B. bovis</i>, is interesting. The main nuclear body consists of a karyosome
surrounded by a clear area. There is also a loose (chromidial) mass of chromatin
representing the remains of the chromatin forks seen during the formation of the
parasite as a daughter form by gemmation. Occasionally there is a small dot or
point, the so-called âblepharoplastâ of Schaudinn and LÃ¼he. This minute dot is
not a flagellate blepharoplast, for there is no flagellate stage in the life-history of
Babesia. These nuclear phenomena have been described by Nuttall and Graham-Smith
and Christophers (1907)<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> for <i>B. canis</i>, by Fantham (1907)<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> for <i>B. bovis</i>, and
by Thomson and Fantham (1913) from glucose-blood cultures of <i>B. canis</i>.</p></div>

<p>Babesia are tick borne, as was first shown by Smith and Kilborne
(1893). The developmental cycle in the tick is incompletely known.
The best accounts are those of Christophers (1907)<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> for <i>B. canis</i> and
Koch (1906) for <i>B. bovis</i>, and these accounts are supplementary.
The principal stages, so far as known, may be summarized <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) The piroplasms taken by the tick in feeding on blood pass into the tickâs
stomach. The pyriform parasites, which alone are capable of further development,
are set free from the blood corpuscles. In about twelve to eighteen hours they
become amÅboid, sending out long, stiff, slender, pointed pseudopodia. The
nucleus of each parasite divides unequally into two. Similar forms have been
obtained in cultures. These stellate forms may be gametes, and according to Koch
fuse in pairs.</p>

<p>(2) A spherical stage follows, possibly representing the zygote. This grows, and
a uninucleate globular mass results. This form is found in large numbers on the
third day, according to the observations of Koch.</p>

<p>(3) A club-shaped organism is next formed. This may represent an oÃ¶kinete
stage. The club-shaped bodies are motile and gregarine-like, and are about four
times the size of the blood forms. These club-shaped bodies and subsequent stages
were described by Christophers in the development of <i>B. canis</i> in the dog-tick,
<i>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span></p>

<p>(4) The club-shaped bodies pass from the gut of the tick into the ovary, and so
get into the ova. There they become globular, and later are found in the cells of
the developing tick-embryo. The parasites are, then, transmitted hereditarily.
Similar globular bodies are found in the tissue cells of the body of tick nymphs
which have taken up piroplasms. The globular stage was called the âzygoteâ by
Christophers, but it may correspond to the oÃ¶cyst of Plasmodia.</p>

<p>(5) The globular body divides into a number of âsporoblasts,â which become
scattered through the tissues of the larval or nymphal tick, as the case may be.</p>

<p>(6) The sporoblasts themselves divide into a large number of sporozoites, which
are small uninucleate bodies, somewhat resembling blood piroplasms. The sporozoites
collect in the salivary glands of the tick. They are inoculated into the
vertebrate when the tick next feeds.</p></div>

<p>The chief species of <i>Babesia</i> and their pathogenic importance
may be listed <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) <i>Babesia bovis</i> (Babes) produces infectious hÃ¦moglobinuria
of cattle in Europe and North Africa. It is transmitted by <i>Ixodes
ricinus</i>. A similar parasite also occurs in deer.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Babesia bigemina</i> (Smith and Kilborne) produces Texas
fever, tristeza, or red-water in cattle in North and South America,
South Africa and Australia. It is transmitted by <i>BoÃ¶philus annulatus</i>
in North America, by <i>B. australis</i> in Australia, South America, and
the Philippines, and by <i>B. decoloratus</i> in South Africa.</p>

<p>The parasite is from 2&nbsp;Âµ to 4&nbsp;Âµ long, and from 1Â·5&nbsp;Âµ to 2&nbsp;Âµ broad.</p>

<p><i>Babesia bigemina</i> may be the same parasite as <i>B. bovis</i>.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Babesia divergens</i> (MacFadyean and Stockman) is a small
parasite. It is found in cattle suffering from red-water in Norway,
Germany, Russia, Hungary, Ireland, Finland, and France, and is
transmitted by <i>Ixodes ricinus</i>.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Babesia canis</i> (Piana and Galli-Valerio) gives rise to malignant
jaundice or infectious icterus in dogs in Southern Europe, India, and
other parts of Asia and North Africa, where it is transmitted by
<i>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</i>. In Africa generally, especially South
Africa, the disease is transmitted by <i>HÃ¦maphysalis leachi</i>. <i>Babesia
canis</i> varies from 0Â·7&nbsp;Âµ to 5&nbsp;Âµ, the size depending partly on the
number of parasites within the corpuscle. It averages about 3&nbsp;Âµ. It
has been cultivated in Bassâ medium (glucose and infected blood),
see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_172">172</a>.</p>

<p>In India <i>Piroplasma gibsoni</i> (Patton) infects hunt dogs and jackals.
It is annular or oval in shape.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Babesia ovis</i> (Babes) produces âCarceag,â a disease of sheep
in Roumania, the Balkan Peninsula, Italy, and Transcaucasia. It
varies in size from 1&nbsp;Âµ to 3&nbsp;Âµ. It is transmitted by <i>Rhipicephalus
bursa</i>. The parasite has recently been recorded from Rhodesia.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Babesia caballi</i> (Nuttall and Strickland) causes âbiliary
feverâ in equines. The parasite occurs in Russia, Roumania, and<span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>
Transcaucasia. It varies in size from 1&nbsp;Âµ to 2&nbsp;Âµ. It is transmitted by
<i>Dermacentor reticulatus</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It should be mentioned that <i>Nuttallia equi</i> also causes âpiroplasmosisâ in
equines, with symptoms of hÃ¦moglobinuria and jaundice in Italy, Sardinia, many
parts of Africa, Transcaucasia, India, and Brazil. In Africa it is transmitted by
<i>Rhipicephalus evertsi</i>. It has been shown experimentally that a horse recovered
from <i>Babesia caballi</i> was susceptible to the inoculation of <i>Nuttallia equi</i> blood.</p></div>

<p>(7) <i>Babesia pitheci</i> (P.&nbsp;H. Ross) was found in a monkey,
<i>Cercopithecus</i> sp., in Uganda. The pear-shaped forms measure 1Â·5&nbsp;Âµ
by 2Â·5&nbsp;Âµ.</p>

<p>(8) <i>Babesia muris</i> (Fantham)<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> was found in white rats. The
pyriform parasites are 2&nbsp;Âµ to 3&nbsp;Âµ long and 1&nbsp;Âµ to 1Â·5&nbsp;Âµ broad; oval
forms are 0Â·5 to 1Â·5&nbsp;Âµ diameter.</p>

<p>The usual symptoms of babesiasis (piroplasmosis) are high fever,
loss of appetite, hÃ¦moglobinuria, icterus, anÃ¦mia, paralysis, and
death in about a week in acute cases. In chronic cases there is
anÃ¦mia, and hÃ¦moglobinuria is less marked. When animals recover,
there are still some piroplasms left in the blood. âRecoveredâ or
âsaltedâ animals are not susceptible to reinfection, but ticks feeding
on them acquire piroplasms, and are a source of danger to freshly
imported animals.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Trypan-blue is the best drug, as shown by Nuttall and Hadwen<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>
(1909). It should be administered intravenously in 1 to 1Â·5 per cent. aqueous solution.
A dose of 5 to 10&nbsp;c.c. is curative for dogs, one of 100 to 150&nbsp;c.c. for horses and
cattle. Unfortunately, the tissues are coloured blue by the drug. The âsaltedâ
animals, after trypan-blue treatment, still harbour the parasites in their blood for
years.</p></div>


<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Theileria</b>, Bettencourt, FranÃ§a and Borges, 1907.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The organisms belonging to this genus are rod-like or bacilliform, and coccoid
or round.</p>

<p>The best known of the species of Theileria is <i>T. parva</i>, the pathogenic agent of
East Coast fever or Rhodesian fever in cattle in Africa.</p></div>


<p class="spec"><b>Theileria parva</b>, Theiler, 1903.</p>

<p class="syn">Syn.: <i>Piroplasma parvum</i>.</p>

<p>In the blood corpuscles of infected cattle minute rod-like and
oval parasites are seen. Some are comma shaped and others are
clubbed (fig.&nbsp;92, <i>1â12</i>). The rod-like forms measure 1&nbsp;Âµ to 3&nbsp;Âµ in
length by 0Â·5&nbsp;Âµ in breadth; the oval forms are 0Â·7&nbsp;Âµ to 1Â·5&nbsp;Âµ in
diameter. The intracorpuscular parasites are said by R. Gonder
(1910) to be gametocytes, the rod-like forms being thought to
be males, the oval forms to be females. Free parasites are practically
never seen in the blood. It is known that it is impossible to<span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>
produce the disease in a healthy animal by blood inoculation, but
only by intraperitoneal transplantation of large pieces of infected
spleen (Meyer). There may be as many as eight parasites in a corpuscle.
The chromatin is usually at one end of the organism. In
some parasites the appearance of the chromatin suggests division, but
such division, if it takes place, must be very slow, as it has not been
actually seen in progress. The red blood corpuscles appear merely to
act as vehicles for the parasites (Nuttall, Fantham, and Porter).<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the internal organs, especially the lymphatic glands, spleen and bone-marrow,
are found multinucleate bodies known as Kochâs blue bodies (fig.&nbsp;92, <i>13â18</i>). These
are schizonts, according to Gonder.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> The actual Kochâs blue bodies are said to be
extracellular, but similar multinucleate bodies, schizonts, occur in lymphocytes. The
schizonts divide and the merozoites resulting probably invade the red blood corpuscles
in the internal organs. Gonder considers that the sporozoites injected by
the tick collect in the spleen and lymphatic glands, penetrate the lymphocytes and
give rise to the schizonts.</p>

<p>Gonder has studied the cycle of <i>T. parva</i> in the tick. He states that the
gametocytes leave the host corpuscles and give rise to gametes, then conjugation
occurs producing zygotes. The zygotes are then said to become active to form
ookinetes, and to enter the salivary glands of the tick. Multiplication is said to
occur therein, producing a swarm of sporozoites. This work needs confirmation.</p>

<p><i>T. parva</i> is transmitted by <i>Rhipicephalus appendiculatus</i>, <i>R. simus</i>, <i>R. evertsi</i>,
<i>R. nitens</i>, and <i>R. capensis</i>. The parasites are not hereditarily transmitted in
<i>Rhipicephalus</i>, but when taken by the transmitter at one stage of its development
the tick is infective in its next stage (<i>e.g.</i>, if the larva becomes infected, then the
nymph is infective; if the nymph becomes infected, then the adult is infective).</p>

<p>An animal recovered from <i>Theileria parva</i> is incapable of infecting ticks, but few
animals recover from East Coast fever. Animals suffering therefrom do not show

<p>This genus<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> may be mentioned here. The organisms included therein are,
according to Theiler, coccus-like, consisting of chromatin, and are devoid of cytoplasm.
They occur in the red blood corpuscles of cattle, causing a disease characterized
by destruction of red cells, fever and anÃ¦mia, but with yellow urine. The
disease is tick transmitted. The bodies now called <i>Anaplasma marginale</i> were
formerly described as marginal points. They multiply by simple fission. They are
said by Theiler to cause gall-sickness in cattle in South Africa. Some authors doubt
whether these bodies are organismal.</p></div>


<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Paraplasma</b>, Seidelin, 1911.</p>

<p>Under this generic name Seidelin described certain bodies found
by him in cases of yellow fever in 1909. The type species is
<i>P. flavigenum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> and is claimed by Seidelin to be the causal agent of
yellow fever.</p>

<p><i>Paraplasma flavigenum</i> occurs in the early days of the disease as
small chromatin granules with or without a faint trace of cytoplasm.
The bodies are usually intracorpuscular. Also, somewhat larger forms,
with distinct cytoplasm, are seen in small numbers. During the later
days of the disease still larger forms are found, and these occur also
in sections of organs (<i>e.g.</i>, kidney) made post-mortem. Some of these
larger forms are perhaps schizonts. In the second period of the
disease possible micro- and macro-gametes may be found, some of
which are extracorpuscular. Some small free bodies have been seen.
Recently schizogony has been stated to occur in the lungs, and it is
said that guinea-pigs can be inoculated with <i>Paraplasma flavigenum</i>,
and show yellow pigment in the spleen.</p>

<p>Seidelin places <i>Paraplasma</i> in the <i>BabesiidÃ¦</i>, with resemblances
more particularly to <i>Theileria</i>. V. Schilling-Torgau and Agramonte
have criticized these findings; the former considers them to be the
resultant of certain blood conditions.</p>

<p><i>P. subflavigenum</i> was found by Seidelin in 1912 in a man suffering
from an unclassified fever in Mexico.</p>

<p>Further, it is now known that a Paraplasma occurs naturally in
guinea-pigs. More researches are needed on these matters, as some
writers (<i>e.g.</i>, Wenyon and Low) claim that the bodies are not
organismal.</p>

<div class="insert">
<p><i>Paraplasma flavigenum.</i>&mdash;The Yellow Fever Commission (West
Africa) in their third report, dated 1915, have come to the conclusion
that there is no evidence that the bodies termed <i>Paraplasma flavigenum</i>
are of protozoal nature or that they are the causal agents of
yellow fever.</p>

<p>These parasites, which were discovered by Johannes MÃ¼ller (1841), live principally
in fishes, and occasionally cause destructive epizoÃ¶tics amongst their hosts. MÃ¼ller
first observed them in the form of whitish-yellow pustules on the skin or on the gills
of various fishes. These pustules contained masses of small shell-covered bodies with
or without tails (âpsorosperms,â see fig.&nbsp;93). Similar bodies were also found in the
air bladders of certain fish. Creplin (1842) demonstrated the resemblance of the cysts
(âpsorosperm tubesâ) harbouring the psorosperms to the âpseudonavicella-cystsâ of
a gregarine, as described by v. Siebold. Dujardin (1845) considered that there was
possibly some connection between the protoplasmic âpsorosperm tubesâ and the
spores they contained, and the developmental stages of monocystid gregarines from the
vesiculÃ¦ seminales of earth-worms. The relationship of the âfish psorospermsâ was
placed on a firmer basis by Leydig (1851) and LieberkÃ¼hn. The former found numerous
forms in marine fish, and he discovered in species which live free in the gall bladder
of cartilaginous fishes that the psorosperms originated in a manner similar to the
gregarines. LieberkÃ¼hn (1854) studied the Myxosporidia in the bladder of the pike
(fig.&nbsp;93, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>), and observed their amÅboid movements, as well as the formation of
the spores, from each of which a small amÅboid body escaped, a discovery that
was confirmed by Balbiani. The same author also found that spiral filaments were
enclosed in the so-called polar body, <i>i.e.</i>, the polar capsule of the psorosperm spores,
and that these could be protruded (fig.&nbsp;93, <i>d</i>, and fig.&nbsp;95).</p></div>

have made important additions to our knowledge of the Myxosporidia: Perugia,
ThÃ©lohan, Mingazzini, L. Pfeiffer, L. Cohn, Doflein, Mercier, SchrÃ¶der and Auerbach;
while the presence of this parasite outside the class of fishes has become known
through Lutz, Laveran, and others. The species causing disease in fishes have been
described by Ludwig, Railliet, Weltner, L. Pfeiffer, Zschokke, Hofer, Doflein, Gurley,
Plehn, Schuberg, Fantham and Porter. With regard to classification the works of

<p>The Myxosporidia live either free on the epithelial surface of hollow organs
(gall or urinary bladder, renal tubules, but never in the intestine), or are enclosed in
the tissues of their host. The gills and muscular system are their favourite
habitat, but other tissues or organs may be attacked. Species of Myxosporidia
are also known from Amphibia, Reptilia, and a few invertebrates.</p>

<p>The free forms, which are often amÅboid (fig.&nbsp;96), move by the aid of variously
shaped pseudopodia, have a constant form, or may exhibit contractions of the body.
The tissue parasites often reach a considerable size, so that the integument of the
host forms protuberances over them. They are of a roundish or irregular shape.
Frequently they are enveloped in a connective tissue covering formed by the host.</p>

<p>The protoplasmic body in the trophic phase (fig.&nbsp;96) shows a distinct ectoplasm
which is finely granular or sometimes striated, and an endoplasm which is coarsely
granular and contains many nuclei as well as cell inclusions, such as crystals, pigment
grains and fat globules. The nuclei originate by division from the primitive
nucleus of the amÅboid germ that issues from the spore. This amÅbula may or
may not live intra-cellularly during the early stages of its existence.</p>

<p>The multinucleate trophozoite of a Myxosporidian forms spores in its endoplasm
practically throughout its whole period of growth (fig.&nbsp;96). Vegetative reproduction
by a process of external budding or plasmotomy may also occur, as in <i>Myxidium
lieberkÃ¼hni</i> from the urinary bladder of the pike.</p>

<p>The myxosporidian trophozoite may produce two spores within itself, when
it is placed in the sub-order <i>Disporea</i>, or it may produce numerous spores, which
is characteristic of the sub-order, <i>Polysporea</i>. The phenomenon of spore formation<span class="pagenum" title="183"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>
is not simple (fig.&nbsp;97), and the spore itself is surrounded by a bivalved shell or sporocyst
and contains polar capsules in addition to the amÅboid germ (fig.&nbsp;97, <span class="lowercase smcap">G</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">H</span>). The
valves of the sporocyst and the polar capsules are really differentiated nucleate cells,
so that each spore is an aggregate of cells rather than one cell, though only a single
amÅbula issues from a spore. The accounts of spore formation vary somewhat
according to the different workers.</p>

<p>Spore formation is usually very complicated and there are differences of opinion
as to the interpretation of various stages, particularly as to whether conjugation
occurs therein. The process is initiated by the concentration of cytoplasm around
one of the nuclei of the endoplasm, so that a small spherical mass or initial corpuscle
is produced, the pansporoblast (Gurley) or primitive sphere (ThÃ©lohan). Some
authors state that a pansporoblast really results from a conjugation of two initial
corpuscles (fig.&nbsp;97, <span class="lowercase smcap">A-D</span>). Nuclear multiplication occurs within the pansporoblast
(fig.&nbsp;97, <span class="lowercase smcap">E</span>), and sooner or later two multinucleate sporoblasts are formed within it
(fig.&nbsp;97, <span class="lowercase smcap">F</span>). Each sporoblast gives rise to a single spore, which consists of a sporocyst
or envelope composed of two valves each secreted by a cell, two polar capsules
each secreted by a cell, and the sporoplasm or amÅbula which becomes binucleate
(fig.&nbsp;97, <span class="lowercase smcap">G</span>). During the process of spore formation (fig.&nbsp;97) various vegetative and
reduction nuclei may be produced, in addition to those which are essentially involved
in spore formation, and the sporocyst cells may be developed early.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Each spore contains two (figs.&nbsp;94, 95) or more polar capsules which are clearly
visible in the fresh condition. Each polar capsule is a hollow, more or less pear-shaped
body, secreted by a cell and having a well defined contour. Within it, a
long, delicate, elastic filament, the polar filament, is formed, and lies spirally coiled
in the polar capsule until just before the emergence of the amÅbula from the spore
(fig.&nbsp;95). The polar filament is ejected, probably under the influence of the digestive<span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>
juice, when the spore reaches a new host, and serves to anchor the spore to the
tissue with which it is in contact, and thus allow of the emergence of the amÅbula
in a situation suitable for its development. The polar capsule with its contained
polar filament has been compared with the stinging cells or nematocysts of the
CÅlentera, but it has a totally different function.</p>

<p>The spores fulfil the purpose of effecting transmission to other hosts. Infection
occurs by the ingestion of the parasites per os after their escape by some
means from their host. ThÃ©lohan and others have demonstrated that the valves of
the spores soon open under the influence of the digestive juices, thus allowing the
young myxosporidia to escape. Their further history is unknown; but it may be
surmised that they either travel direct to the organs usually affected (gall bladder,
urinary bladder), or are distributed in the body by means of the circulatory or
lymphatic systems.</p>

<p>The Myxosporidia that invade tissues are often deadly to their hosts. They may
be present in a state of âdiffuse infiltrationâ when practically every organ of the
body may be infected, as in barbel disease (due to <i>Myxobolus pfeifferi</i>). On the
other hand, the parasites may be concentrated at one spot, when cysts, either large
or small, are produced. Such cysts occur on the gills of many fishes. A few additional
important pathogenic forms are <i>Myxobolus cyprini</i>, the excitant of âpockenkrankheitâ
of carp, and <i>Lentospora cerebralis</i>, parasitic in the skeleton of SalmonidÃ¦
and GadidÃ¦. The skeletons of the tail, fins and skull particularly are seats of infection,
and from the skull the Lentospora can spread to the semicircular canals, resulting
in loss of power to maintain its balance on the part of the fish. On this account
the malady is termed âdrehkrankheit.â Young fish are more particularly infected.
<i>Myxobolus neurobius</i> infects the spinal cord and nerves of trout.</p>

<p>Myxosporidia are divided into two sub-orders&mdash;<i>Disporea</i> and <i>Polysporea</i>&mdash;according
to whether they form only two or several spores during their growth.
The former include two genera limited to fishes, which are easily distinguishable by
the shape of the spores: <i>Leptotheca</i>, ThÃ©l., with a rounded spore, and <i>Ceratomyxa</i>,
ThÃ©l., with a very elongate spore. The larger number of genera belong to the
<i>Polysporea</i>, which are divided into three families:</p>

<p>These are the organisms discovered in the stickleback by Gluge in 1834, and
in <i>Coccus hesperidum</i> by Leydig in 1853. They have since been found in numerous
other arthropods, especially insects. They acquired particular importance when it
was discovered that they were the cause of the âpÃ©brineâ disease (âgattinaâ of
the Italians) which caused so much destruction amongst silkworms (<i>Bombyx mori</i>).
Pasteur (1867â70) and especially Balbiani (1866) participated in the researches on
<i>Nosema bombycis</i>, and it was the latter who classed the âpÃ©brine bodiesâ or âpsorospermia
of the arthropodaâ amongst the Sporozoa as Microsporidia (1882).<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> The complete
life cycle of <i>N. bombycis</i> was described in 1909 by Stempell. The Microsporidia
are not confined to insects and arachnoids, they are now known to occur also in
crustacea, worms, bryozoa, fishes, amphibians and reptiles. Certain tumours in
fishes, similar to those formed by many Myxosporidia, are produced by Microsporidia.
Fantham and Porter found that <i>Nosema apis</i> was pathogenic to bees<span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>
and other insects, and was the causal agent of the so-called âIsle of Wightâ
disease in bees<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The Microsporidia, as their name implies, form minute spores which usually are
oval or pear-shaped. Each spore contains a single polar capsule which is not easily

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The life cycle of <i>Nosema apis</i>, parasitic in bees, may be taken as an example of
that of a microsporidian. The infection of the host is initiated by the ingestion of
spores of <i>N. apis</i> in food or drink contaminated with the excrement of other infected
bees. Under the influence of the digestive juice of the bee the spore-coat (sporocyst)
softens, the polar filament is ejected and anchors the spore to the gut epithelium,
and the minute amÅbula contained in the spore emerges. The amÅbula is capable
of active amÅboid movements (fig.&nbsp;98, <i>b</i>) and so is termed the planont or wandering
form (fig.&nbsp;98, <i>a</i>). After a short time each planont penetrates between or into the cells
of the epithelium of the gut, a few only passing through into the body cavity. Within
the cells the amÅbulÃ¦ become more or less rounded, lose their power of movement,
and after a period of growth of the trophozoite (fig.&nbsp;98, <i>c</i>) commence to divide actively,
these dividing forms being known as meronts (fig.&nbsp;98, <i>d</i>). Various forms of fission
occur, and during this phase, termed merogony, the numbers of the parasite within
the host are greatly increased, with concomitant destruction of the epithelium
(fig.&nbsp;98, <i>e</i>). After a time sporogony commences. The full-grown meront becomes
successively the pansporoblast and sporoblast. Nuclear multiplication and differentiation
ensue and five nuclei are ultimately produced. At the same time a sporocyst
is secreted, and two vacuoles are produced within. One is the polar capsule, and<span class="pagenum" title="186"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span>
within it the polar filament is differentiated; the other forms the posterior vacuole
(fig.&nbsp;98, <i>g</i>). Between the two vacuoles the body cytoplasm or sporoplasm forms a
girdle-like mass. Of the nuclei, one regulates the polar capsule, two control the
secretion of the sporocyst, and two remain in the sporoplasm. The polar capsule and
polar filament are not usually visible in the fresh condition, but can be demonstrated
by the use of various chemical reagents (fig.&nbsp;100). The sporoplasm ultimately becomes
the amÅbula (fig.&nbsp;98, <i>g</i>) which issues from the spore after the ejection of the polar
filament.</p></div>

<p>A trophozoite (meront) of <i>N. apis</i> becomes a single pansporoblast which gives
rise to one sporoblast producing one spore, and this procedure is characteristic of
the genus <i>Nosema</i>. In other genera the trophozoite may form more than one pansporoblast
and each pansporoblast may form a variable number of spores in different
cases. Various attempts at classification have been based on these characteristics.
It must suffice here to note that in the cases where the trophozoite becomes one
pansporoblast, the latter can produce four spores in the genus <i>Gurleya</i>, eight spores
in <i>ThÃ©lohania</i> and many spores in <i>Pleistophora</i>. In other cases, where the trophozoites
give rise to many pansporoblasts, each of the latter may form many spores,
as in the genus <i>Glugea</i>.</p>

<p>A few pathogenic microsporidian parasites other than <i>N. apis</i> may be mentioned.
<i>N. bombycis</i>, causing pÃ©brine in silkworms, may infect any or all the tissues of the
host (fig.&nbsp;99). The larvÃ¦ of the host, <i>i.e.</i>, the âsilkworms,â may become infected by
eating food contaminated with spore-containing excrement of already infected silkworms.
In cases of heavy infection the silkworm dies, but should the infection be
less intense the larva becomes a pupa in which the parasite persists, so that the moth
emerges from the cocoon already infected. Not only is the moth parasitized itself,
but the Nosema reaches the generative organs of both sexes and penetrates the
ovaries of the female, with the result that the ova are deposited infected. Such
infected eggs are capable of developing, so that infection may be transmitted
hereditarily as well as by the contaminative method. Infected eggs can be recognized
by microscopic examination, as Pasteur showed, and thus preventive measures
may be adopted.</p>

<p>A microsporidian parasite is known to occur on the roots of the spinal and cranial
nerves of <i>Lophius piscatorius</i>, the angler fish. This parasite is variously referred to
the genera <i>Nosema</i> and <i>Glugea</i>.</p>

<p><i>ThÃ©lohania contejeani</i>, parasitic in the muscles of crayfish, is believed by some
to be the causal agent of recent epizoÃ¶tics among them, though others believe the
disease to be really due to a bacillus. It may be that the one organism aids in the
entry of the other into the host.</p></div>

discovered by Miescher in 1843. This
author found white filaments running
parallel with the direction of the fibres
in the voluntary muscles of mice. They
were visible to the naked eye, and proved
to be cylindrical tubes tapering at each
end. They were as long as the muscular
fibres, were enveloped in a membrane, and
contained innumerable elongate or kidney-shaped
bodies and a smaller number
of little spherical forms. Th. v. Hessling
confirmed (1853) the occurrence of these
âMiescherâs tubesâ within the muscular
fibres, this author having discovered the
same structures in the heart muscles of
deer, cattle, and sheep. Both investigators considered them to be pathological transformations
of the muscles. v. Siebold, from his own experiences, regarded them
as fungus-like entophytes.</p>

<p>Rainey (1858) discovered similar structures in the muscular system of pigs, and
considered them to be early stages of <i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i>, which error Leuckart
rectified, simultaneously emphasizing their relationship with Myxosporidia. Both
these authors found them in the muscular fibres, and both observed that they
possessed a thick striated membrane. Manz (1867) published the results of more
minute investigations on the structure and contents of the cylinders. This observer
also recognized the disease in rabbits and attempted to cultivate the parasites. He
also tried to induce experimental infection in guinea-pigs, rats, and mice, but the
result was negative.</p>

<p>However, domestic and wild mammals are not the only hosts of Sarcosporidia;
these parasites are also harboured by birds. Thus, according to KÃ¼hn, they are
found in the domestic fowl; according to Rivolta in <i>Turdus</i>, <i>Corvus</i>, and other
birds; according to Stiles in North American birds; while Fantham found Sarcosporidia
in the African mouse-bird, <i>Colius</i>. Reptiles also are parasitized occasionally.
Bertram found them in the gecko, LÃ¼he in the wall-lizard. It was found also that
the Sarcosporidia could develop not only in the muscles but also in the connective
tissue. This led to the foundation of a new, but provisional, classification by Blanchard,
using the generic name <i>Miescheria</i> for the parasites in the muscles and
<i>Balbiania</i> for those in the connective tissue. Finally, Sarcosporidia have also been
observed in man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="188"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span></p>

<p>The relation of these parasites to certain diseases of domestic animals has been
studied by veterinary surgeons. Sarcosporidia may cause fatal epizoÃ¶tics among
sheep.</p>

<p>There is still a wide field open for research in regard to the structure and development
of these parasites, and the manner in which the hosts become infected.</p></div>

<p>The Sarcosporidia usually appear as elongate, cylindrical, or
fusiform bodies, rounded at both extremities and of various lengths
and breadths (fig.&nbsp;102). In some species they may be from 16&nbsp;mm.
to 50&nbsp;mm. long, as in the sheep and roebuck. These bodies are the
so-called sarcocysts or Miescherâs tubes. They lie in transversely
striated muscular fibres which they distend more or less. The forms
found in the connective tissue are apparently parasites which originally
inhabited the muscular fibres, and only on disintegration of the fibres
reached the connective tissue, where they grow to large oval or globular
bodies (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_105">105</a>). The mammalian muscles usually infected are those
of the Åsophagus, larynx, diaphragm, body-wall, and the psoas muscles.
The skeletal muscles may be affected in acute cases, as well as those
of the tongue and eye. The heart muscles are sometimes parasitized.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In fresh material cut into thin slices the parasites are frequently recognizable, even
with the naked eye, because of their yellowish-white colour. Under the microscope
they appear to be coarsely granular (fig.&nbsp;103). Beginners may find some difficulty
in distinguishing them from other foreign bodies, such as dead and calcified encapsuled
TrichinÃ¦, or from Cysticerci that have died and become calcified in the early
stages, more particularly as the Sarcosporidia also occasionally may become calcified.</p></div>

</div>

<p>The Sarcosporidia are always enveloped in a membrane, which
is probably formed at an early stage. In a few cases it remains thin<span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>
and simple, in other cases a radially striated ectoplasmic layer is
present (figs.&nbsp;104, 108), which has been variously described. From the
inner integument, which may be homogeneous or fibrous, thick or
thin, membranes or trabeculÃ¦ pass into the
interior of the body, forming anastomosing
partitions, and so producing a system of
chambers of various sizes that do not communicate
with one another (figs.&nbsp;104, 108).
These chambers are occupied by sickle- or
bean-shaped bodies (spores or sporozoites),
or various developmental stages of them.
The oldest spores are found in the centre of
the Miescherâs tubes or trophozoites. If they
are not liberated they die there, so that the
central chambers of the tube are empty and
hollow.</p>

<p>In the youngest Sarcosporidia (40&nbsp;Âµ in
length) from the muscles of the sheep there
occur, according to Bertram, small roundish
or oval cells (4&nbsp;Âµ to 5&nbsp;Âµ), the nuclei of which
are half their size, and are embedded in a
granular protoplasmic mass. In somewhat
larger, and therefore older, cylinders, the
investing membrane of which already shows
both layers, the cells have become larger (to
7&nbsp;Âµ) and are more sharply outlined from each
other (fig.&nbsp;106). These uninucleate cells may
be considered as pansporoblasts. In each
pansporoblast division of the nucleus occurs
(fig.&nbsp;107), and meanwhile the pansporoblasts
become isolated within the chambers, the dividing partitions
of which originate from the granular protoplasm which is present
between the pansporoblasts. The numerous uninucleate daughter
forms produced within the chambers become spores direct (fig.&nbsp;108).</p>

<p>The process commences in the centre of the cylinders or sarcocysts,
and then progresses towards the extremities, the parasites meanwhile
increasing in size, and new pansporoblasts being continually
formed at the extremities (fig.&nbsp;107).</p>

<p>The spores (sometimes called Raineyâs corpuscles), vary in shape
according to the species, but are also of different form individually.
They are mostly kidney-, bean- or sickle-shaped (fig.&nbsp;109), and of
small size, sometimes reaching 14&nbsp;Âµ by 3&nbsp;Âµ to 5&nbsp;Âµ. They are
apparently surrounded by a thin membrane, and at one extremity
(according to the discovery of L. Pfeiffer, confirmed by van Eecke,<span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span><span class="pagenum hide" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>
Laveran and Mesnil) contain an obliquely striated body (fig.&nbsp;109) often
homologized with the polar capsule, while the greater part of the spore
is taken up by the nucleate sporozoite. Several authors state that they
have also observed filamentous appendages (polar filaments) at one
end of the spores, and have seen two kinds of spores in the same
Sarcosporidium. Spores of various species of Sarcosporidia may
contain metachromatic granules, often centrally placed (fig.&nbsp;109).
These granules may be metabolic or possibly may contain toxin
(see below).</p>

<p>The gymnospores of <i>Sarcocystis muris</i>, from the mouse, show active
boring movements when kept in saline solution warmed to 35Â° or
37Â°&nbsp;C. <i>S. muris</i> is very deadly to its host. From their structure the
spores do not appear to have great powers of resistance to external
conditions. They measure 12&nbsp;Âµ by 3&nbsp;Âµ to 4&nbsp;Âµ or less.</p>

<p>Laveran and Mesnil (1899) isolated a toxin from <i>S. tenella</i> of
the sheep and called it sarcocystin. This substance is especially
pathogenic to experimental rabbits.</p>

<p>The duration of life of the Sarcosporidia is a comparatively long
one. The affected muscular fibres may remain intact and capable of
performing their functions for a long time,
but at last they perish, if the host lives long
enough. Thus the Sarcosporidia of the
muscles are then enveloped only by sarcolemma,
and finally, when this likewise disappears,
they fall into the intra-muscular
connective tissue. In many cases the Sarcosporidia
die off within their hosts, this,
according to Bertram, being brought about
by a disintegration of the spores in the central
chambers. In other cases the leucocytes
play a part in the destruction of the Sarcosporidia,
and sometimes it happens that lime
salts are deposited in and around the vacant cylinders.</p>

<p>In some places pigs, sheep, mice and rats are infected with
sarcosporidiosis to a remarkable extent, in certain cases almost reaching
100 per cent. Young animals also are infected, and perhaps
infection only takes place during youth.</p>

<p>Although the natural mode of transmission of the Sarcosporidia
remains to be determined, yet various experimental researches on
the problem are of interest and importance. Theobald Smith (1901)
found that mice could be experimentally infected with <i>S. muris</i>
by feeding them with the flesh of other infected mice. The incubation
period was a long one, namely forty to fifty days. Thus, on the
forty-fifth day after feeding young Sarcosporidia were found, and
seventy days after feeding spore formation began. Ripe spores were
found two and a half to three months after the commencement of<span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>
these experiments. This mode of infection&mdash;a cannibalistic one&mdash;hardly
seems likely to be the natural method for the infection of sheep
and ruminants generally. Smithâs researches have been confirmed.
NÃ¨gre<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> (1910) found that the fÃ¦ces of mice fed on infected muscular
tissue were infective to other mice when ingested by them. Negri<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>
infected guinea-pigs with <i>S. muris</i> by feeding them on infected mouse
flesh, and found that the parasite in guinea-pigs showed different
characters from those exhibited by it in mice. Darling<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> also succeeded
in infecting guinea-pigs with <i>S. muris</i>, and Erdmann infected mice
with <i>S. tenella</i> (from the sheep).</p>

<p>According to Erdmann<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> (1910) the Sarcosporidian spore germinates
in the intestine of the host, which has recently ingested infected
material. The spore liberates its contained toxin&mdash;sarcocystin&mdash;which
acts upon the adjacent intestinal epithelium, whereby the latter
is shed, and an amÅbula creeps out of the spore. The amÅbula is
able to penetrate the denuded area and get directly into the lymph-spaces
of the submucous coat of the intestine. The first period of
development, lasting some twenty-eight to thirty days, is said to be
passed in the lymph-spaces of the intestine. Later the amÅbula
reaches a muscle fibre. Writing in May, 1914, Erdmann<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> records the
appearance of small amÅboid and schizogony forms six days after
infection of the host. Crawley<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> (1913) controverts some of these
statements and considers that the Sarcosporidian spore, still sickle-shaped,
bores its way into the epithelial cells of the intestine and
comes to rest there. The spore then becomes round or elliptical, and
peripheral masses of chromatin appear within it, suggesting schizogony.
This happens about twelve hours after feeding, and in twenty-four
hours the spores appear to have left the intestine. More recently (May,
1914), Crawley<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> considers that there is sexual differentiation among the
Sarcosporidian spores, a few hours after their ingestion by the host.</p>

<p>Interesting discussions have occurred as to the site of the toxic
sarcocystin within the spore. Metachromatic granules occur in the
middle of the Sarcosporidian spore (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_109">109</a>), and the toxin may be
contained in these grains, as they disappear, according to Erdmann,
before the amÅbula penetrates the denuded intestinal wall. However,
a polar capsule, containing a polar filament, may be present at one end
of a Sarcosporidian spore. Laveran and Mesnil described a striated
area at the more pointed end of the spore of <i>S. tenella</i>, which
area they consider to represent a polar capsule. Fantham<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> (1913)<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>
found a vacuole-like, polar capsule area in the spores of <i>S. colii</i>
from the African mouse-bird. The sarcocystin may be contained
in the polar capsule. The nucleus of the spore is generally at the
opposite, blunter end.</p>

<p>Again, various authors have stated that Sarcosporidian spores may
occur in the blood of the host at times. If so, then an intermediate
host may be concerned in their transmission. Perrin suggested that
Sarcosporidia might be spread by blow-flies and flesh-flies.</p>

<p>The classification of the Sarcosporidia as proposed by R.
Blanchard, which was based on their various habitats, can no longer
hold, because the same species may occur in the muscles as well as
in the connective tissue. For the present, the few species that are
known may be placed in one genus, <i>Sarcocystis</i>, Ray Lankester, 1882.</p>

<p>The following species of <i>Sarcocystis</i> are of <span class="nowrap">interest:&mdash;</span><br />
<i>S. miescheriana</i>, KÃ¼hn, 1865, in the pig.<br />
<i>S. bertrami</i>, Doflein, 1901, in the horse.<br />

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Sarcosporidia observed in Man.</span></p>

<p>(1) Lindemann<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> found on the valves and in the myocardium of
a person who had died of dropsy certain brownish masses, 3&nbsp;mm. in
length and 1Â·5&nbsp;mm. in breadth which he regarded as gregarines. If
these were actually independent animal organisms it may be suggested
that they were Sarcosporidia. Rivolta (1878) named the species
<i>S. lindemanni</i>.</p>

<p>(2) Rosenberg<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> found a cyst 5&nbsp;mm. in length and 2&nbsp;mm. in breadth
in a papillary muscle of the mitral valve of a woman, aged 40,
who had died from pleuritis and endocarditis. The cyst contained
no scolex nor hooklets of tÃ¦nia. Numerous small refracting bodies,
round, oval or kidney-shaped, were found in a daughter cyst, as well<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
as sickle-shaped bodies. The description hardly appears to indicate
Sarcosporidia.</p>

<p>(3) Kartulis<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> observed Miescherâs cylinders of various sizes in
the liver (?) and in the muscular system, of a Sudanese who had
succumbed to multiple abscesses of the liver and abdominal muscles.
This may be considered as the first actual case of the occurrence of
Sarcosporidia in man. Koch in 1887 described a case in Egypt.</p>

<p>(4) The case reported by Baraban and St. Remy<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> was at once
demonstrated as certain. It related to a man who had been executed,
and in the laryngeal muscles of whom Sarcosporidia were found; the
length of the parasites varied between 150&nbsp;Âµ and 1,600&nbsp;Âµ, their
breadth between 77&nbsp;Âµ and 168&nbsp;Âµ. The affected muscular fibres were
distended to four times their normal thickness. This species was
described by Blanchard as â<i>Miescheria</i>â <i>muris</i>, but according to
Vuillemin, it was more probably <i>Sarcocystis tenella</i> of the sheep.</p>

<p>(5) Vuillemin has also described a case of Sarcosporidia found
in the muscles of a man who died from tubercle at Nancy. The
author considered that the parasite corresponded to <i>S. tenella</i>.</p>

<p>(6) Darling<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> (1909) found Sarcosporidia in the biceps of a negro
from Barbados.</p>

<p>The Myxosporidia, Microsporidia, Actinomyxidia and possibly the
Sarcosporidia may be included within the section <b>Cnidosporidia</b>
(Doflein), since they possess spores containing polar capsules.</p>


<p class="spec">Order. <b>Haplosporidia</b>, Caullery and Mesnil.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Haplosporidia are a group of organisms having both a simple structure and
life-history. The simplicity may represent a primitive condition or may be due to
degradation resultant on parasitism, and thus it is possible that the group is not
a homogeneous one. The order Haplosporidia was created by Caullery and Mesnil
in 1899, and includes parasites of rotifers, annelids (fig.&nbsp;110), crustacea, fish, prochordates
and man. They may be present in the body cavity or alimentary tract,
and can also occur in the septum nasi of man, in the nervous system of Cephalodiscus,
and in tumours of fish.</p>

<p>As the name implies, the spores of the Haplosporidia are simple, without polar
capsules, and are uninucleate. In some genera, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Haplosporidium</i>, <i>Urosporidium</i>
(fig.&nbsp;111) there is a spore-coat or sporocyst which may be elongate or spiny.
The developmental cycle of a Haplosporidian, such as <i>Haplosporidium</i> or <i>Bertramia</i>,
begins with a small, uninucleate cell, often rounded, possessing a cell membrane that
may be prolonged into processes. Growth takes place, coupled with an increase in
the number of nuclei, so that a multinucleate trophozoite is produced. Later, this<span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>
multinucleate trophozoite becomes segmented into a number of ovoid or spherical
pansporoblasts, which give rise to few (one to four) spores. Such a spore, when set
free, begins the life cycle over again.</p>

<p>More recently (1905â1907) two important organisms have been described and
included in this group, namely, <i>Neurosporidium cephalodisci</i><a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> (Ridewood and
Fantham) from the nervous system of the prochordate, <i>Cephalodiscus nigrescens</i>,
and <i>Rhinosporidium kinealyi</i> (or <i>seeberi</i>) from the septum nasi of man. In the case
of <i>Rhinosporidium</i> and <i>Neurosporidium</i>, after the uninucleate spore has grown into
a multinucleate trophozoite, the latter segments into uninucleate pansporoblasts,
as in the preceding cases. A difference then occurs, for each pansporoblast
enlarges, its nucleus divides and a âspore-morulaâ is formed. Thus a multinucleate
pansporoblast or spore-morula, divided into many uninucleate sporoblasts (spore
mother cells) is produced, and each sporoblast without further change becomes
a uninucleate spore.</p>

<p>The Haplosporidia have therefore been divided by Ridewood and Fantham (1907)<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a>
into two <span class="nowrap">sections:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) The <i>Polysporulea</i>, wherein the pansporoblast gives rise to a number of
spores (nine or more), <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Rhinosporidium</i>, <i>Neurosporidium</i>.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>Oligosporulea</i>, wherein the pansporoblasts give rise each to a few (four)
spores or to only a single spore, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Haplosporidium</i>, <i>Bertramia</i>, <i>CÅlosporidium</i>,
<i>Ichthyosporidium</i>.</p></div>

<p class="spec"><b>Rhinosporidium kinealyi</b>, Minchin and Fantham, 1905.</p>

<p><i>Rhinosporidium kinealyi</i>, parasitic in man, must now be considered
in greater detail. This organism was found in nasal polypus
in India, and has since been recorded from the ear as small nodules
in the external auditory meatus. The Indian cases came from the<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>
neighbourhoods of Calcutta and Madras, and the parasite has been
seen in Ceylon. Similar structures have since been described from
the United States and South America.</p>

<p>The Rhinosporidium polypus is said not to be particularly painful,
though nasal forms must interfere with breathing to some extent. The
first nasal polyp reported from India formed a vascular pedunculated
growth on the septum nasi and was about the size of a large pea or
raspberry. It was compared with a raspberry, being red in colour
with a number of small whitish dots upon its surface. When the
tumour was cut, a number of similar whitish dots were seen within.
These were the cysts of Rhinosporidium. According to Minchin
and Fantham<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> (1905), they vary considerably in size and measure up
to 200&nbsp;Âµ or 250&nbsp;Âµ in diameter. Each possesses a cyst wall which varies
in thickness in different cysts. Its outer wall is always firm and
distinct, the inner limit being less definite at times. Each large cyst
is filled with numbers of spherical or oval bodies, showing every
gradation between small ones at the periphery and large ones at the
centre (fig.&nbsp;112). Roughly, three zones of parasites can be distinguished
in a large cyst, a peripheral set consisting of the youngest
parasites, an intermediate group and a central, oldest zone. A large
cyst may possess a pore for the egress of its contents. Some of the
cysts show polar distribution of the zones.</p>

<p>The youngest forms of Rhinosporidium are difficult to detect.
They are small, granular masses, round, ovoid or irregular and at times
even amÅboid in appearance. These are young trophozoites. They
increase in size, but encystment occurs early, the outer layer becoming
firm so that the organisms have a definite contour. Each is soon
multinucleate and the cytoplasm segments around the nuclei. The
cyst thus becomes full of uninucleate pansporoblasts or sporonts,
with a peripheral layer of undifferentiated protoplasm. The pansporoblasts
grow in size. In the larger cysts the formation of
pansporoblasts progresses at the expense of the peripheral layer of
protoplasm, which, however, continues to grow, so that the cyst as
a whole increases in size. The pansporoblasts at first are uninucleate
(fig.&nbsp;112, <i>a</i>), and then undergo nuclear multiplication. This is well seen
in the intermediate zone of parasites, where the pansporoblasts show
first one, then two, then four or more spores (fig.&nbsp;112, <i>b</i>), while in the
oldest centrally placed pansporoblasts, about a dozen or sixteen
closely packed spores (fig.&nbsp;112, <i>c</i>), can be seen. The spore is small
and rounded, and its nucleus is clear and distinct. The fully formed
pansporoblast or spore morula becomes surrounded by a membrane.</p>

</div>

<p>Certain of the cysts have been found in a ruptured condition,<span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>
whereby the spores have been liberated into the surrounding tissue.
It is almost certain that the spores serve for the auto-infection of the
host, for though the tumours of Rhinosporidium seemed to have
been removed entirely, it has been found that they recur, some
minute fragment of the parasite having probably been left behind.
The method whereby the parasite reaches new hosts has not yet been
determined, and it would be of interest if its life-history could be
more fully investigated.</p>

<p>The Asiatic specimens of <i>R. kinealyi</i> were first described in detail
by Minchin and Fantham (1905) from material briefly reported to the
Laryngological Society of London in 1903, by OâKinealy. Material
obtained by Dr. Nair, of Madras, was described by Beattie<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> in 1906.
This material came from Cochin. Castellani and Chalmers have
found similar polypi in Ceylon.</p>

<p>Wright<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> has described the parasite from Memphis, Tennessee.
Seeber<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> in 1896 described nasal polypi in Buenos Ayres, and in 1900
Wernicke named the parasite therein <i>Coccidium seeberi</i>. Seeberâs
parasite is a Rhinosporidium, <i>R. seeberi</i>, and may ultimately be found
to be the same as <i>R. kinealyi</i>. Ingram<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> reports Rhinosporidium cysts,
with pores in the cyst walls, in conjunctival polypus and in papilloma
of the penis in India. Zschokke has reported the presence of <i>Rhinosporidium</i>
in horses in South Africa.</p>

<h4>Class IV. <b>INFUSORIA</b>, LedermÃ¼ller, 1763.</h4>

<p>The Infusoria (or Heterokaryota, Hickson, or Ciliophora, Doflein)
include the Ciliata and the Suctoria. A few authorities, including
Braun, raise the Suctoria (or Acinetaria) to separate rank as a class,
but this is not widely followed.</p>

<p>The body of the Ciliata usually is bilaterally symmetrical and is
enveloped in a cuticle which has numerous openings for the
protrusion of the cilia. Most kinds have a fixed shape, whilst
changes in the form of others are brought about by the contractions
of the body substance. The latter exhibits hyaline ectoplasm, in
which myonemes, and occasionally also trichocysts (minute spindle-shaped
bodies) appear, and granular endoplasm which may contain
numerous vacuoles. The cilia, on whose various arrangements
the classification is based, are always processes of the ectoplasm.
Their form varies; they may be hair-like, or more rarely thorn-like,
spur-like, or hook-shaped; undulatory membranes also may occur,
which are probably composed of fused cilia.</p>

<p>With the exception of some of the parasitic species, an oral cavity,
peristome or cytostome, is always present. It is frequently beset
with cilia or provided with undulatory membranes, which help to
waft the food inwards; sometimes there is an anal aperture (cytopyge)
generally placed at the opposite pole of the organism. A cytopharynx
fringed with cilia or sometimes with a specialized supporting
apparatus is connected with the peristome. Vacuoles form round
the ingested food, and in many species a constant rotation goes on
in the endoplasm. Often one, and sometimes two contractile vacuoles
are present, the frequency of the pulsations of which depends on the
surrounding temperature. Sometimes special conducting channels
lead to the vacuoles, or there are outlet channels leading to the exterior.</p>

<p>There is in almost every case a large nucleus (macronucleus),
and lying close up to it a small nucleus (micronucleus). The form
of the large nucleus varies according to the species. Numerous
nuclei are not very common, but these occur in <i>Opalina</i>, which lives
in the hind-gut of amphibia, and is also distinguished by the absence
of an oral aperture.</p>

<p>Reproduction is effected by binary fission; less commonly, after
encystment, by multiple division, or by budding. The divisions can
be repeated many times, but finally cease, and then the conjugation
of two specimens brings about a regeneration, particularly of the
nuclei. Numerous examinations (BÃ¼tschli, Hertwig, Maupas, Calkins)
have demonstrated that after two individuals have associated by
homologous parts of the body, the micronucleus separates from
the macronucleus, becomes larger and divides twice by mitosis, so<span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>
that four micronuclei are present in each one of the two individuals
forming the couple. Three of these nuclei perish and become
absorbed, the fourth gradually passes to the portion of protoplasm
connecting the two conjugants, which has originated by absorption
of the cuticle at the point of contact of the conjugants. After a
further division one micronucleus of each conjugant passes over
into the other conjugant, and fusion ensues between the two micronuclei
of each individual. Complicated changes and divisions may
occur, but only the main principles can be noted here. A new nuclear
body is thus formed in each conjugant, and soon divides into two.
Of the segments thus produced one becomes a micronucleus, and
one or several of the others, as the case may be, form or amalgamate
into a new macronucleus, the old macronucleus usually perishing or
becoming absorbed during the conjugation. Usually, sooner or later,
the two conjugants separate, or may have separated already, and again
multiply independently by fission until a series of divisions by simple
fission is again followed by conjugation. The theoretical significance
of conjugation cannot be dealt with fully here. It may be
remarked, however, that the macronucleus plays no part in it, but
governs entirely the metabolism of the Infusorian, whereas the
micronucleus is essentially a generative nucleus from which macro-
and micro-nuclei are again and again produced.</p>

<p>Encystment amongst the Infusoria is very general, and is essentially
a means of protection when the surrounding medium dries up.
Doubtless these cysts are frequently carried long distances by the wind,
which explains the wide geographical distribution of most species.
Also, multiplication often takes place in the encysted condition.</p>

<p>Some Infusoria live a free life, others are sedentary; the latter
form colonies in fresh as well as in salt water. Numerous species
are parasites of various lower and higher animals,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> and a few also are
parasitic in man.</p>

<p>The Prague zoologist, v. Stein, introduced a classification of the
Infusoria that has been almost universally adopted. It is founded
on the different position of the cilia on the body. Though, no
doubt, artificial, it is a convenient system. BÃ¼tschli has compiled a
better one.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> But for our purpose Steinâs system is <span class="nowrap">sufficient:&mdash;</span></p>

the posterior extremity. There are coarse cilia along the entire left border and the
anterior part of the right border. Longitudinal striation is distinct and regular.
There are two contractile vacuoles on the right, and occasionally also two or more to
the left. The anus (cytopyge) is terminal. The macronucleus is usually horse-shoe
or kidney-shaped, sometimes oval; the micronucleus contiguous. Reproduction is
by binary fission and conjugation, and encystment occurs. The cysts are spherical
or oval. These ciliates are parasitic in the large intestine of human beings and
pigs, in Amphibia, and in the body cavity of polychÃ¦te Annelida.</p></div>

<p class="spec"><b>Balantidium coli</b>, Malmsten, 1857.</p>

<p class="syn">Syn.: <i>ParamÃ¦cium coli</i>, Malmsten, 1857.</p>

<p>The body is oval, 60&nbsp;Âµ to 100&nbsp;Âµ in length (up to 200&nbsp;Âµ according
to Janowski), and 50&nbsp;Âµ to 70&nbsp;Âµ in breadth. The peristome is funnel-shaped
or contracted, the anterior end being then broadened or
pointed according to the degree of contraction (figs.&nbsp;113, 114). The
ecto- and endo-plasm are distinct, the latter is granular, containing
drops of fat and mucus, granules of starch, bacteria, and occasionally<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
also red and white blood corpuscles. There are usually two contractile
vacuoles, seldom more. The anus (cytopyge) opens at the
posterior extremity. The macronucleus is bean- or kidney-shaped,
rarely oval; the micronucleus is spherical.</p>

<p><i>Balantidium coli</i> lives in the large intestine of man, in the rectum of
the domestic pig, and has been found in monkeys. It propagates by
transverse division, but conjugation and encystment are known to
take place.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> Transmission to other hosts is effected by the cysts of
the parasite (fig.&nbsp;114).</p>

<p><i>Balantidium coli</i>, first seen by Leeuwenhoek, was described
by Malmsten in 1857 in a man aged 35 years, who had two
years previously suffered from cholera, and since then had been
subject to diarrhÅa. The examination showed an ulcer in the rectum
above the mid sphincter ani, in the sanguineous purulent secretion of
which numerous Balantidia were swimming about. Although the
ulcer was made to heal, the diarrhÅa did not cease and the stools
contained numerous Balantidia, the number of which could only be
decreased by extensive enemas of hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>The second case related to a woman who was suffering from
severe colitis, and who died ten days after admission. The malodorous,
watery evacuations contained innumerable Balantidia, in
addition to pus, and at the autopsy the anterior portion of the large
intestine was found to be infested with them.</p>

<p>Subsequently this parasite has often been observed in human
beings, and various cases have been recorded. These occurred in
Russia, Scandinavia, Finland, Cochin China, Italy, Germany, Serbia,
Sunda Islands, Philippine Islands, China, and in other parts of Asia
and in America. Other cases were reported by Askanazy, Ehrnroth,
Klimenko, Nagel, Koslowsky, Kossler, Waljeff, Strong and Musgrave,
Glaessner<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> and others. Sievers found <i>B. coli</i> very common in Finland.</p>

<p>In the majority of the cases described by Sievers from Finland,
and in other cases from Central Europe, the patients suffered from
obstinate intestinal catarrh, which did not always cease even after
the Balantidia had disappeared. On the other hand, Balantidia have
occasionally still been found to persist, though in small numbers, after
the catarrh has been cured. Some authors, nevertheless, do not<span class="pagenum" title="202"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>
regard Balantidia as the primary cause of the various diseases of the
large intestine, which often commence with the development of
ulcers, but they consider that they may aggravate these diseases and
render them obstinate. According to Solowjew, Askanazy, Klimenko
and Strong and Musgrave, however, the parasites penetrate the intestinal
wall, and give rise to ulcerations which may extend deeply into
the submucosa, and even be found in the blood and lymphatic vessels
of the intestinal wall. According to Stokvis, <i>B. coli</i> occurs also in
the lung; at all events this author states that he found one living and
several dead paramÃ¦cia (?) in the sputum of a soldier, returned from
the Sunda Islands, who was suffering from a pulmonary abscess.
Sievers has shown that <i>B. coli</i> might occur in persons not suffering
from intestinal complaints, but E.&nbsp;L. Walker<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> (1913) states that every
person parasitised with <i>B. coli</i> is liable sooner or later to develop
balantidian dysentery.</p>

<p>Since Leuckart confirmed the frequent presence of <i>B. coli</i> in the
rectum of pigs, and corresponding observations were made in other
countries, the pig is universally considered to be the means of the
transmission of Balantidium to man. The encysted stages only serve
for transmission, because, according to all observations, the free
parasites have a very small power of resistance. They perish when
the fÃ¦ces have become cool; they cannot live in ordinary, slimy, or
salt water. As they are killed by acids even when much diluted, they
cannot pass through the normal stomach alive except under the most
unusual circumstances. The pigs, in whose intestines the Balantidium
appears to cause little or no disturbance, evacuate numerous encysted
Balantidia with the fÃ¦ces, and their occasional transference to man
brings about their colonization there, but perhaps only when a disease
of the colon already exists.</p>

<p>Experimental transmission of the free parasites to animals (per os
or per anum) yielded negative results, even in the case of pigs.
Casagrandi and Barbagallo (1896), however, had positive, as well as
negative, results. They employed healthy young cats, or cats in which
catarrhal entero-colitis had been artificially induced (which in other
experiments is apt to cause the death of the animals experimented upon
in about six or seven days), or finally cats that had dilatation of the
rectum with alkaline reaction of the fÃ¦ces. An attempt to infect three
healthy cats by injecting human fÃ¦ces containing Balantidium into the
rectum proved negative, in so far as the fÃ¦ces of the experimental
animals had an acid reaction and contained no Balantidia, but at the
autopsy performed eight days after infection a few encysted parasites
were found in the mucus of the ileum. In the case of four cats<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
suffering from entero-colitis, into which human fÃ¦ces containing
Balantidia were introduced per os, Balantidium cysts were found in
the fÃ¦ces three days after the last ingestion. Great numbers, moreover,
were found in the cÃ¦cum and the posterior part of the small
intestine at the autopsy of the animals, which died about eight days
after the commencement of the experiments. Actual colonization,
therefore, was not effected in either series of experiments. Free or
encysted Balantidia of pigs were used for further experiments. The
experiments proved negative when fÃ¦ces containing cysts were injected
into the rectum of healthy cats (three experiments), or cats (two)
suffering from spontaneous intestinal catarrh, or when such material
was introduced per os into three healthy cats. In the case of two
cats with intestinal catarrh artificially produced, a small number of the
active Balantidia injected into the rectum remained alive. Larger
quantities of fÃ¦ces containing encysted Balantidia were introduced
into two other cats affected with the same complaint. These, certainly,
did not appear in the fÃ¦ces, but small numbers, free and alive, were
found in the cÃ¦cum. Similarly, encysted Balantidia were introduced
into two cats with dilated rectum, and whose fÃ¦ces had an alkaline
reaction. In these cases no parasites appeared in the fÃ¦ces, but three
and five days later, when the two animals were examined, a very small
number were discovered free in the large intestine. Klimenko did
not succeed in infection experiments with <i>B. coli</i> on young dogs,
whose intestines had been artificially affected by disease.</p>

<p>More recent experiments by Brumpt have shown that young
sucking pigs can be infected with Balantidium from infected monkeys
(<i>Macacus cynomolgus</i>) and suffer heavily from the same, whereas the
Balantidium of the pig is rarely harmful to its host. This and previous
experiments may be thought to suggest that there are perhaps
several pathogenic species, and also that harmless strains of Balantidium
may occur. At the same time, it must be remembered that
a large proportion of the cases recorded of Balantidian colitis occur
among swineherds and butchers, that is, among people in frequent
contact with pigs. Morphologically, there are practically no differences
between the Balantidia found in man, monkeys and pigs, and
it is probable that one species only, under slightly different environmental
conditions, may be responsible for the colitis observed. In
any case, efficient prophylactic measures should be taken against
balantidiasis in countries where it may occur, by confining the pigs
and not allowing them to run in yards and dwellings.</p>

<p>E.&nbsp;L. Walker (1913) has given a good summary of work on
balantidiasis. His own researches in the Philippines showed that
monkeys could be infected by Balantidia both from pigs and men.
Parasites may appear in the stools only at infrequent intervals. He<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
believes that the ciliates are the primary etiologic factor in the
symptoms and lesions of balantidian dysentery.</p>

<p>Behrenroth (1913) has given an interesting account of <i>Balantidium
coli</i> and its pathogenic significance.</p>

<p>The body is of oval form, with the anterior extremity pointed, and
posterior extremity broad and rounded (fig.&nbsp;115). The length is 20&nbsp;Âµ
to 32&nbsp;Âµ, and the breadth is 14&nbsp;Âµ to 20&nbsp;Âµ. The peristome, which is
fissure-like, extends to the centre of the body (fig.&nbsp;115). The right
lateral border of the peristome is beset with cilia the same length as
those of the body, the left side terminates in a thin hyaline membrane
that extends towards the back, and can
pass over to the right side. A row of
longer and stronger cilia (cirri) are on the
left border of the peristome. The cuticle
is refractile, the ectoplasm hyaline and
the endoplasm granular, with numerous
food vacuoles.</p>

<p>A single contractile vacuole lies dorsally
and to one side at the posterior
extremity. The macronucleus, which is
always spherical, is central and is 6&nbsp;Âµ to
7&nbsp;Âµ in diameter. The micronucleus, close
in front of it, only measures 1&nbsp;Âµ (fig.&nbsp;115).
The cysts are oval.</p>

<p>These parasites were found in numbers
in the evacuations of a man aged 30,
who was born in Germany and had repeatedly travelled between
Hamburg and North America, where he made long stays. The patient
came to the CharitÃ© in Berlin to seek advice for constipation alternating
with diarrhÅa accompanied by abdominal pain.</p>

<p>A second case (the parasite of which was described as <i>Colpoda

<p>As, in both cases, the parasites only appeared during the diarrhÅa,
and disappeared as soon as the fÃ¦ces had assumed a normal consistency,
or could only be demonstrated in a few encysted specimens,
it may be assumed that the small intestine or the duodenum is
their habitat.</p>

in whom <i>Balantidium minutum</i> was discovered.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Nyctotherus giganteus</b>, P. Krause, 1906.</p>

<p>Under the name <i>Balantidium giganteum</i> n. sp., P. Krause described
an Infusorian which was repeatedly observed with <i>Trichomonas intestinalis</i>
in the alkaline evacuations of a typhoid patient in Breslau.
The body is ovoid, narrower and rounded anteriorly and broader
and stunted posteriorly. The peristome lies to one side; the macronucleus
is bean-shaped, the micronucleus small and globular; one
or two vacuoles are present. The anus is at the farther end. The
organism is 90&nbsp;Âµ to 400&nbsp;Âµ long, 60&nbsp;Âµ to 150&nbsp;Âµ broad (fig.&nbsp;117). After a
prolonged stay outside the body, it becomes rounded and encystment
occurs. In the thermostat the Infusoria remain alive at 37Â°&nbsp;C. for five
weeks.</p>

<p>The species, however, hardly belongs to <i>Balantidium</i>, but to all
appearances is a <i>Nyctotherus</i> and is distinguished from <i>N. faba</i> by the
difference in size.</p>

<p>In the fÃ¦ces of a native of Uganda who suffered from sleeping
sickness and diarrhÅa and had in his intestine <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>,
<i>Trichocephalus trichiurus</i> and <i>Ancylostoma duodenale</i>, Castellani found
a curiously shaped Infusorian, 40&nbsp;Âµ to 50&nbsp;Âµ long, and 35&nbsp;Âµ to 40&nbsp;Âµ

vacuole (fig.&nbsp;118). He included the organism in the genus <i>Nyctotherus</i>,

<p>G. Lindner, in Cassel, studied certain peritrichal Infusoria (stalkless Vorticella),
and connected them, probably incorrectly, with the most varied diseases of man and
domestic animals, even with Sarcosporidia of pigs. It may be mentioned that
according to a communication by letter from Schaudinn, Vorticella may be found
in freshly evacuated fÃ¦ces, but always only after the administration of a water
enema. In spite of this, several other investigators mention VorticellÃ¦ as
intestinal parasites of man.</p>

<p>The <i>Chilodon dentatus</i> (Ehrenberg) recorded in 1903 by J. Guiart as a parasite
of man, which may be found in all infusions, can hardly have lived in the man
from whose fÃ¦ces it was cultivated, but may represent a chance admixture both in
the fÃ¦ces and the cultivations. <i>C. uncinatus</i> was also found as a chance parasite
of man by Manson and Sambon. According to Doflein<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> (1911) certain Chilodon-like
organisms have been found by Selenew in prostate secretions in gonorrhÅa.
Other species of the genus <i>Chilodon</i> are known, but only as ectoparasites (<i>e.g.</i>,
<i>Chilodon cyprini</i>, Moroff, 1902, from the skin and gills of diseased carp).</p>

<p>A number of other parasitic Ciliates are known, among which <i>Ichthyophthirius
multifiliis</i>, destructive to fish, is important. It lives in the skin and the layers
immediately below it, forming small whitish pustules which may become confluent.<span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
The pustules are most common on the head and fins, but occur also on the eyes and
gills of the host. The young parasite, which is one of many formed in a cyst, is very
small. At first it is free swimming, but soon attaches itself to the skin of a fish. It
bores inwards and becomes surrounded by the irritated skin. There it attains a
relatively large size, being 500&nbsp;Âµ to 750&nbsp;Âµ and occasionally more in diameter. The
body has a rounded terminal mouth, short cytopharynx and a number of minute
contractile vacuoles. The macronucleus is large and horseshoe-shaped; the small
micronucleus is only seen in the very young animal. When full grown, the organism
encysts and forces its way to the surface and bursts through, leaving a small, gaping
wound behind. The cyst sinks to the bottom of the water, nuclear multiplication
occurs and a number of young parasites are produced, which leave the cyst and
either attack new hosts or else perish.</p>

<p><i>Opalina ranarum</i>, parasitic in the rectum and urinary bladder of frogs and toads,
shows great degradation and simplification due to parasitism, possessing no separate
micronuclei, no cytostome, cytopharynx or cytopyge. It has many macronuclei, and
is a large parasite. During summer and autumn nuclear multiplication followed by
division of the body occurs, the process being repeated after the daughter forms
have grown to the size of their parent. In spring, the Opalina divide rapidly, but
do not grow much before dividing again. Finally, tiny forms, containing three to
six nuclei, encyst and pass from the host with the fÃ¦ces. As these latter are greedily
devoured by tadpoles, the <i>Opalina</i> gain new hosts in which they develop.</p></div>


<h5>THE CHLAMYDOZOA.</h5>

<p>The name Chlamydozoa was proposed by Prowazek in 1907 for a
number of minute, problematic organisms (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_119">119</a>) believed to be
the causal agents of certain diseases in man and animals, such as
vaccinia and variola, trachoma, inclusion blenorrhÅa in infants,
molluscum contagiosum, and bird epithelioma contagiosum. Other
diseases possibly due to Chlamydozoa<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> are hydrophobia, measles,
scarlet fever, foot-and-mouth disease, the âGelbsuchtâ disease of silkworms,
and perhaps even typhus (Prowazek, 1913). The subject is
difficult and controversial and can only be briefly discussed here.
It is known that the viruses in all these diseases can pass through
ordinary bacterial filters, that is, they belong to the group of âfilterable
viruses.â At such periods the organisms are extracellular or free. It
is also known that in many of these cases the virus produces definite
and characteristic reaction-products or cell-inclusions in the infected
cells, during the intracellular phase of the life-history of the organism.
As the organisms to be considered are problematic, it will be convenient
to summarize their <span class="nowrap">history:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) Cell-inclusions, usually named after their discoverers, have
been found in certain diseases, thus: In vaccinia Guarnieriâs bodies,<span class="pagenum" title="208"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span>
in scarlet fever Malloryâs bodies, in hydrophobia Negriâs bodies, in
trachoma Prowazekâs bodies occur.</p>

<p>(2) At first these characteristic cell-inclusions were considered to
be actual parasitic organisms causing the diseases in question. The
bodies received zoological names and attempts were made to work
out their supposed development cycles. The supposed parasites of
vaccinia and variola were referred to a so-called genus <i>Cytoryctes</i>,
those of hydrophobia to <i>Neuroryctes</i>, of scarlet fever to <i>Cyclasterium</i>,
while those of molluscum contagiosum were referred to the Coccidia.
Calkins in 1904 studied in detail the cell-inclusions of vaccinia and
small-pox, calling them <i>Cytoryctes variolÃ¦</i>, Guarnieri. Calkins considered
that in the stratified cells of the epidermis they passed through
two cycles, the one cytoplasmic, the other intranuclear. The first is
the vaccinia cycle, the second the pathogenic (intranuclear) variola
cycle. It is hardly necessary to follow all Calkinsâ stages here.</p>

<p>Negri (1909) described a cycle for <i>Neuroryctes hydrophobiÃ¦</i>. Calkins
refers both <i>Cytoryctes variolÃ¦</i> and <i>Neuroryctes hydrophobiÃ¦</i> to the
Rhizopoda.</p>

<p>Siegel (1905) described quite different organisms under the name
<i>Cytorhyctes</i>. He listed several species: <i>C. vacciniÃ¦</i>; of vaccinia and
small-pox, <i>C. scarlatinÃ¦</i> of scarlet fever, <i>C. luis</i> of syphilis (this is
probably the granule stage of <i>Treponema pallidum</i>), and <i>C. aphtharum</i>
of foot-and-mouth disease.</p>

<p>(3) The afore-mentioned views were criticized, and the bodies
were not considered to be living organisms but merely reaction
products or cell-inclusions due to the effects of the virus on the host
cells. Thus Guarnieriâs bodies were stated to consist of extruded
nucleolar or plastin material, having no developmental cycle. It was
further asserted that infection could be produced by lymph in which
Guarnieriâs bodies had been destroyed. Similar assertions have been
made regarding the Negri bodies, and others. The <i>Cytoryctes</i>,
<i>Neuroryctes</i>, etc., are considered, according to these views, to be
degeneration products of the nucleus or to be of a mucoid nature.</p>

<p>(4) More recently a positive belief has gained ground that there
are true parasitic organisms causing these diseases, and that the
parasites are very minute, being termed Chlamydozoa by Prowazek
and Strongyloplasmata by LipschÃ¼tz.</p>

<p>The Chlamydozoa are characterized by (<i>a</i>) their very minute size,
smaller than any bacteria, so that they can pass through bacterial
filters; (<i>b</i>) they pass through intracellular stages, in the cytoplasm
or the nucleus of the host cell, producing therein the reaction
products or inclusions in the cell already recorded as characteristic
or diagnostic of the diseases produced; (<i>c</i>) they pass through definite
developmental cycles. Such a cycle consists essentially of growth<span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>
and division. The mode of division of the Chlamydozoa resembles
that of the centriole of a cell, by the formation of a dumb-bell-shaped
figure. Two dots are observed connected by a fine line or strand
which becomes drawn out and finally snaps across the middle.
Prowazek and AragÃ£o (1909) working on smallpox in Rio de Janeiro
found that the chlamydozoal granules passed through a Berkefeld
filter and that the filtrate was virulent. But if an âultra-filterâ were
used, <i>i.e.</i>, one coated with agar, then the granules were retained and
the filtrate was no longer virulent. The surface of the ultra-filter was
found to contain many granules.</p>

<p>The Chlamydozoa are parasites of epiblastic tissues (<i>e.g.</i>, epidermal
cells, nerve cells, conjunctival cells).</p>

(<i>b</i>) cluster of granules surrounded by mantles. Ã&nbsp;2,000
approx. (Original. From preparation by Fantham.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The life-history of a ChlamydozoÃ¶n (fig.&nbsp;119), such as that of
vaccinia, is, according to Prowazek, Hartmann and their school, as
<span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The infection begins with <i>elementary bodies</i> or <i>elementary
corpuscles</i> which live at first extracellularly. An elementary body is
a minute speck of chromatin, apparently devoid of cytoplasm, which
can pass through a bacterial filter. It can enter a host cell, but the
entry is not a process of phagocytosis.</p>

<p>2. Inside the host cell the elementary body grows in size, and
becomes an <i>initial body</i> (fig.&nbsp;119, <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>3. A reaction on the part of the host cell results, for nucleolar,
plastin substance is extruded from the cell-nucleus and surrounds
the parasitic initial body. The latter is thus enveloped in a mantle
(hence the name Chlamydozoa, from ÏÎ»Î±Î¼á½Ï, a mantle), and the
characteristic cell-inclusion (Guarnieriâs body, Negriâs body, etc.) is
produced. The nucleolar, mantle substance probably represents the
âcytoplasmâ of <i>Cytoryctes</i>, described by Calkins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span></p>

<p>4. The body next breaks up into a number of smaller bodies
known as <i>initial corpuscles</i>. These, in their turn, divide by simple
division (in the manner already described) into numerous elementary
bodies (fig.&nbsp;119). Thus, the life-cycle is completed.</p>

<p>The Chlamydozoa are, then, the minute granules inside the body of
the <i>Cytoryctes variolÃ¦</i> or the <i>Neuroryctes hydrophobiÃ¦</i>, so that the whole
body of the <i>Cytoryctes</i> or <i>Neuroryctes</i> corresponds to the mantle and
parasite of the ChlamydozoÃ¶n. The Cytoryctes group is said to
cause destruction of the host cell. The CytoÃ¶ikon group (<i>e.g.</i>,
trachoma bodies) causes proliferation of the host cell.</p>

<p>In September, 1913, Noguchi<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> described the cultivation of the
parasite of rabies in an artificial medium, similar to that used by him
for the cultivation of <i>SpirochÃ¦ta recurrentis</i>. The cultures were stated
to be infective to dogs, rabbits and guinea-pigs. Levaditi, in
December, 1913, stated that he had succeeded in cultivating spinal
ganglia of rabid monkeys in monkey plasma.</p>

<p>Noguchi and Cohen (November, 1913)<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> have succeeded in
cultivating the so-called trachoma bodies, or at any rate bodies
very closely resembling them morphologically. The medium
employed was Noguchiâs ascitic fluid and rabbit kidney medium, as
used for spirochÃ¦tes. The coarser cultural forms stained blue with
Giemsaâs solution, the finer ones stained red. Attempts to infect
monkeys from the culture tubes failed.</p>

<p>From their behaviour on treatment with such reagents as saponin,
bile and sodium taurocholate, Prowazek considers that the Chlamydozoa
approach the Protozoa.</p>

<p>The mouth is either situated at the anterior end of the body, or is shifted more
or less backwards on to the flat ventral surface. The alimentary canal consists of a
short fore-gut, which is frequently provided with a muscular pharynx, and of a simple
forked or branched mid-gut; there is neither a hind-gut nor an anus; in one class,
the Cestodes, the alimentary canal has entirely disappeared except for muscular
remnants in the scolex.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">INTEGUMENT OF THE BODY</span> consists either of a ciliated epithelium of only
one layer (Turbellaria), or of a cuticle and gland-like cells embedded in the
parenchyma, or subcuticular layer (Cestodes, Trematodes). The dermo-muscular
layer consists of annular, longitudinal, and even diagonal fibres, while the
parenchyma is traversed by dorso-ventral fibres.</p>

<p>The central <span class="lowercase smcap">NERVOUS SYSTEM</span>, which is embedded in the parenchyma of the
body, consists of cerebral ganglia, united together in the shape of dumb-bells, and
of two or more longitudinal <span class="lowercase smcap">MEDULLARY FASCICLES</span>, often forming transverse
anastomoses. Organs of sense usually occur only in the free-living species, more
rarely during the free-living stages of a few parasitic species and in a few ectoparasitic
forms.</p>

<p>[In Platyhelminthes simple eye-spots frequently occur, and in a few an auditory
vesicle.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blood-vessels</span> and definite <span class="lowercase smcap">RESPIRATORY ORGANS</span> are lacking [except in
<i>Nemertinea</i>]; the <span class="lowercase smcap">EXCRETORY APPARATUS</span> (formerly termed water-vascular system)
is typical of the entire class. It commences in the interstices of the parenchyma,
with peculiar terminal cells (ciliated funnels), which will be described later (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_219">219</a>),
the capillary processes of which go on uniting into larger branches, and finally form
two large collecting vessels, which, sometimes separately and sometimes united,
open to the exterior through one, two, or numerous pores.</p>

<p>Nearly all the Platyhelminthes are <span class="lowercase smcap">HERMAPHRODITIC</span>, and in nearly all there are,
in addition to the ovaries producing ova, other glands attached to the female genital
apparatus, namely, the vitellaria or yolk glands, which provide a substance termed
yolk, which serves as nourishment for the embryo. The fully formed eggs have
shells and are âcompound,â <i>i.e.</i>, composed of the egg or ovarian cell, which is
surrounded by numerous yolk cells or their products of disintegration. The two
sexual openings usually lie close together, frequently in the fundus of a genital
atrium; they are rarely separated from one another. Shell glands also usually
occur (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_221">221</a>).</p>

<p>Reproduction is sexual, often, however, combined with asexual methods of
propagation (segmentation, budding). The Platyhelminthes live partly free in fresh

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Class I.</i>&mdash;<b>Turbellaria</b> (or Eddy Worms). Flat worms for the most part, free
living, and always covered with a ciliated epithelium.</p>

<p class="ml2hi5"><i>Order 1.</i>&mdash;<i>RhabdocÅlida</i>, gut unbranched.</p>

<p class="ml2hi5"><i>Order 2.</i>&mdash;<i>Tricladida</i>, gut with three main branches.</p>

<p class="ml2hi5"><i>Order 3.</i>&mdash;<i>Polycladida</i>, a central gut with lateral cÃ¦ca. Development direct
or through metamorphosis. They live in fresh and salt water or on land;
very seldom as parasites.</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i>&mdash;<b>Trematoda</b> (Sucking Worms<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>). [Usually known as Flukes.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]
Flat worms, living as ecto- or endoparasites, that are only ciliated in the larval
condition, and in their adult state are covered with a cuticle, the matrix cells of
which lie in the parenchyma. They have either one, a few, or several suckers,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a>
and frequently also possess chitinous fixation and adhesive organs. The intestine
is single, but generally bifurcated, and not uncommonly there are transverse anastomoses
between the forks or diverticula on them. Excretory organs double, with
two orifices at the anterior extremity or a single one at the posterior end.
Development takes place by a metamorphosis or alternation of generations (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_283">283</a>).
These worms are almost always hermaphroditic, with two or more female and one
male sexual orifice. They live, almost without exception, as parasites on vertebrate
animals, but the intermediate generations are passed in molluscs.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i>&mdash;<b>Cestoda</b> (Tapeworms). Endoparasitic flat worms without an alimentary
canal. The larval stages are rarely ciliated, but are usually provided with six
spines; the adult worm is covered with a cuticle, the matrix cells of which are embedded
in the parenchyma. The body consists of a single segment (Cestodaria) or a
chain of segments, in which case it consists of the scolex and the segments containing
the sexual organs (proglottides) (Cestodes s. str.). The scolex is provided with
various adhesive and fixation organs, and there are calcareous corpuscles in the
parenchyma. Excretory organs symmetrical, opening at the posterior end. These
worms are always hermaphroditic, and then possess one or two female and one
male sexual orifice. During development a larval intermediate stage (âmeasleâ)
occurs and almost always in a different host to that in which the adult sexual worm
lives. The adult stage is parasitic in vertebrate animals; but the larval stage may
occur in invertebrates.</p></div>


<h4>Class II. <b>TREMATODA</b>, Rud.</h4>

<p>These worms are usually leaf- or tongue-shaped, but also barrel-shaped
or conical; they vary from 0Â·1&nbsp;mm. to almost 1&nbsp;m.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> in
length; most of them, however, are small (5&nbsp;mm. to&nbsp;15&nbsp;mm.). The surface
on which the orifice of the uterus and the male sexual opening
are situated is termed the ventral surface; the oral aperture, which
also acts as anus, is always at the anterior end in the sub-order
<i>Prostomata</i> (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_230">230</a>), but in the sub-order <i>Gasterostomata</i> it is ventral.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="213"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span></p>
<p>Suckers are always present and occur in varying numbers and
positions at the anterior extremities as well as on the ventral surface,
and occasionally on the lateral margin and on the dorsum; the
beginning of the intestine (mouth) is always surrounded by a sucker
in the <i>Prostomata</i>.</p>

<p>In or near the suckers there may be chitinous hooks, claws or
claspers, or the surface of the body is more or less covered with spines,
scales or prickles; in one genus (<i>Rhopalias</i>) there are projectile tentacles
beset with spines on the sides of the anterior part of the body.</p>

<p>The body of adult Trematodes is covered by a homogeneous layer
of varying thickness, which either lies directly over the external
layer (basement membrane) of the parenchyma, or over the muscles
embedded in the parenchyma. This investing membrane (cuticle)
arises from pear-shaped or spindle-shaped cells arranged singly or in
groups (which lie between or internal to the diagonal muscles), and
is connected with them by processes; these cells one may regard as
epithelial cells which have sunk down, or possibly as parenchymatous
cells. An epithelium of one layer is also found on the body of
young stages, but it disappears during growth, and only occasionally
do its nuclei persist until adult life. In its place we then find the
cuticle, which, moreover, extends into all the body openings more or
less deeply.</p>

<p>It is thus a debatable point whether the âinvesting layerâ of flukes
is a cuticle&mdash;that is, consists of modified epithelial cells&mdash;or whether it is
a basement membrane, <i>i.e.</i>, compressed and modified connective tissue
cells; in this latter case the true epidermis and cuticle have been cast
off. In the former case the epidermal cells are the pear-shaped cells
referred to above. According to recent authors it consists of two
parts, an outer true cuticle and an inner basement membrane. There
are also unicellular cuticular glands, lying isolated or in groups, which
are termed cephalic, abdominal, or dorsal glands according to the
position of their orifice.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">PARENCHYMA</span> is a connective substance, the structure of
which is still a matter of dispute. It consists, according to some
authors, of multipolar cells, the offshoots from which anastomose with
each other so that a network, permeating the entire body and encompassing
all the organs, is produced. There exists also, as part of it, a
homogeneous matrix, in the form of lamellÃ¦ and trabeculÃ¦ that border
small cavities communicating with each other and filled with fluid.
According to other authors, the parenchyma of the Trematodes consisted
originally of cells, of which, however, only the cell membranes
remain, while the protoplasm has been liquefied except for small residua
around the nucleus. Between these cells an intercellular mass has
appeared. By partial absorption of the walls, adjoining spaces unite,<span class="pagenum" title="214"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span>
and the originally flat cell walls become transformed into trabeculÃ¦.
According to this view the cavities filled with fluid are <i>intra</i>-cellular,
according to the former view <i>inter</i>-cellular. Pigment cells occur only
in a few species.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">MUSCULAR SYSTEM</span> of the Trematodes is composed of (1) a
dermo-muscular tube, (2) the dorso-ventral or parenchymal muscles,
(3) the suckers, and (4) the special muscles of certain organs.</p>

<p>The dermo-muscular tube, which lies fairly close to the cuticle,
consists of annular, diagonal, and longitudinal fibres which surround

developed on the ventral surface as well as in the anterior part of the
body. The <span class="lowercase smcap">MUSCLES OF THE PARENCHYMA</span> are found chiefly in the
lateral parts of the body and pass through the parenchyma in a
dorso-ventral direction; their diverging brush-like ends are inserted on
the inner surface of the cuticle (fig.&nbsp;120).</p>

</div>

<p>The suckers are specially differentiated parts of the dermo-muscular
tube. Their concave inner surface is lined by the continuation
of the cuticle and their convex external surface is covered
by a more dense tissue that frequently takes the form of a refractive
membrane, thus separating them from the parenchymal muscles.</p>

<p>The principal mass of the suckers consists of muscular fibres which
run in three directions&mdash;equatorial, meridional and radial. The
equatorial fibres correspond to the annular muscles, the meridional
fibres to the longitudinal muscles, and the radial fibres to the muscles
of the parenchyma; the radial fibres are always the most strongly<span class="pagenum" title="215"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>
developed. The function of these muscles is evident from their
position; the meridional fibres flatten the suctorial disc and diminish
the depth of its cavity, so that the internal surface may adhere to
the object to be held; if the equatorial fibres now contract, the
sucker rises by elongating longitudinally, and its inner surface is
drawn in by the contraction of the radial muscles. Thus the
sucking disc becomes adherent. Usually also there is a sphincter
at the border of the suckers, which plays its part during the act of
adhesion by constricting in a circular manner that part of the mucous
membrane to which it is attached. The loosening of the fixed sucker
is effected by relaxation chiefly of the radial fibres, by the contraction
of the meridional fibres and certain bundles of muscles situated at
the base and at the periphery of the suckers. The connective and
elastic tissues between the muscles of the suckers probably also take
part in the process.</p>

<p>Of the muscles of the organs which have developed from the
parenchyma muscles we may briefly mention those bundles that are
attached to certain parts of the genital apparatus, to the suckers,
to the hooks and claws, and also, at all events in <i>Fasciola hepatica</i>,
to the spines. The sheaths used for the projection of the tentacles
of the <i>RhopaliadÃ¦</i> are also muscular.</p>

<p>The contractile elements consist of fibres of various lengths
that are mostly parallel to one another, and frequently anastomose;
a cortical substance finely fibrillated can usually be distinguished
from an internal homogeneous mass; large nucleated cells of uniform
size are always connected with them; these have been variously
interpreted, but have been proved to be myoblasts, one or more
of their processes constituting the muscular fibres.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">MOVEMENTS</span> of the Trematodes consist in alterations of form
and position of the body, as well as in creeping movements.</p>

<p>In the <span class="lowercase smcap">NERVOUS SYSTEM</span> (fig.&nbsp;121) can be distinguished a cerebral
portion as well as strands (medullary strands) running from it,
and peripheral nerves. The cerebral portion always consists of
two large ganglia situated in the anterior end of the body which
pass dorsally over the Åsophagus and are connected by means
of a broad and thick commissure composed of fibres only. From
each ganglion three nerves run anteriorly&mdash;the inner and dorsal
nerve for supplying the anterior dorsal part of the body; the
median and ventral for the oral sucker; and the exterior and lateral
likewise for the supply of the sucker.</p>

<p>In a similar manner three strands run backwards from each
ganglion&mdash;one dorsal, one lateral and one ventral. The dorsal and
ventral strands become united and curve backwards; the symmetrical
lateral strands are connected by means of transverse commissures,
the number of which vary according to the species. Such commissures
also exist between the lateral and the two other strands on each
side. There are ganglion cells along the entire course of the posterior
cords, more particularly at the points of origin of the commissures.
There also appears to be in addition a fourth anterior and posterior
pair of nerves, the front pair for the oral sucker and the hind pair
for the pharynx.</p>

<p>The peripheral nerves, which spring from the posterior strands
as well as from the commissures, either pass directly to the muscular
fibres or to the sensory cells that are situated at the level of the
subcuticular cells, or they reach these after the formation of a plexus
situated immediately beneath the dermo-muscular layer; the processes
directed outwards terminate in small vesicles in the cuticle.</p>

<p>As to other <span class="lowercase smcap">ORGANS OF SENSE</span>, simple eyes, two or four in
number, are known in several ectoparasitic species as well as in a<span class="pagenum" title="217"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span>
few free-living larval stages (CercariÃ¦) of endoparasitic forms. In the
adult stage, however, they usually undergo complete atrophy.</p>

</div>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">ALIMENTARY CANAL</span> commences with an oral aperture,
generally terminal or sub-terminal (ventral) at the anterior extremity,
which leads into an oral cavity usually surrounded by a sucker;
the Åsophagus, of various lengths, is directed backwards and is
generally surrounded by a muscular pharynx (fig.&nbsp;122). In some
cases there exists between the sucker and pharynx, pharyngeal pouches
(prÃ¦pharynx). Sooner or later the
intestine divides into two lateral
branches directed backwards, both of
which end blindly (cÃ¦ca) at the same
level.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> In many ectoparasites (<i>Monogenea</i>
[p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_222">222</a>]) a connection exists
between the genital glands and one of
the intestinal branches (ductus vitello-intestinalis
[fig.&nbsp;123]).</p>

<p>The oral cavity, pharyngeal pouches,
pharynx, and Åsophagus are lined with
a continuation of the cuticle of the
body; the gut cÃ¦ca are lined with tall
cylindrical epithelium (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_120">120</a>). The
Åsophagus and intestinal branches
often have also one layer of annular
and longitudinal muscles; the pharynx
has essentially the structure of a sucker
(fig.&nbsp;122).</p>

<p>The accessory organs of the alimentary
canal consist of groups of unicellular <span class="lowercase smcap">SALIVARY GLANDS</span> that
discharge into the Åsophagus in front of or behind the pharynx, or
even into the pharynx itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="218"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span></p>

<p>The food of the Trematodes consists of mucus, epithelial cells, the
intestinal contents of the hosts, and often also of blood, and this not
only in those species living in the vascular system, but also in species
living as ectoparasites or in the intestine or biliary passages of their
hosts.</p>

<p>The final products of assimilation dissolved in the fluids of the

expelled by a definite tubular system (excretory apparatus, proto-nephridia,
formerly also termed the water-vascular system). This
system, which is distributed throughout the entire body (fig.&nbsp;124), is
symmetrically developed, and, in the ectoparasitic Trematodes, it
opens, right and left, at the anterior end on the dorsal surface; in all
other flukes, however, it opens singly into the excretory pore (foramen
caudale) at the centre of the posterior border; in those cases, however,
where a sucker is present at the posterior end, as in the Amphistomata,
the excretory pore is situated on the dorsal surface close in front of
the sucker.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">EXCRETORY SYSTEM</span><a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> consists of several parts: (1) of the more
or less numerous terminal âflameâ cells or funnel cells (figs.&nbsp;124, 125);
(2) of the capillaries ending in them; (3) of
larger vessels receiving the capillaries; and (4)
of the excretory bladder. Terminal cells and
capillaries may be compared to unicellular
glands with long excretory ducts; the cellular
body (fig.&nbsp;125) is comparatively large, stretched
longitudinally, more rarely transversely, and
provided with numerous processes, that are
lost in the parenchyma; within is a conical
cavity (analogous to the secretory cavity of
unicellular glands) which is continued directly
into the structureless capillary; at its blind
end is a bunch of cilia projecting into the
cavity, and which, during life, shows a flickering
motion (ciliary flame). The nucleus is
situated in the protoplasm of the terminal cell
at its blind end.</p>

</div>

<p>The entire apparatus thus begins blindly&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
within the terminal cells, to which must
be ascribed the capacity of taking up from the fluid that permeates
the parenchyma the products which are first collected into their own
cavities and thence excreted by means of the capillaries and vessels.</p>

<p>The vessels possess definite walls, consisting of a membrane and
a nucleated protoplasmic layer. They unite at many points on either
side, and again pass into other canals (<span class="lowercase smcap">COLLECTING TUBES</span>), which
finally, travelling towards the posterior end, discharge into the
excretory bladder (fig.&nbsp;124).</p>

<p>The form and size of the bladder vary much according to the
different species, but it always possesses its own flattened epithelium,
surrounded by circular and longitudinal muscles, the circular muscles<span class="pagenum" title="220"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span>
forming a sphincter around the opening. Frequently also the
structure of the bladder extends to the tubules discharging into
it, which therefore are not to be regarded as separate âvessels,â
but rather as tubular diverticula of the bladder, directed anteriorly.
In some few species the diverticula also branch and the branches
anastomose, so that a network of tubules ensues which receives the
vessels or capillaries. In such cases there are also ciliary tracts in
the tubules.</p>

<p>The contents of the entire apparatus
usually consist of a clear or sometimes
reddish fluid; in some species
there are larger or smaller granules, and
occasionally also concretions occur.</p>

<p><i>Sexual Organs.</i>&mdash;Nearly all the Trematodes are hermaphrodites,
and only a few (<i>SchistosomidÃ¦</i>, <i>Koellikeria</i>) are sexually differentiated.
The sexual organs usually lie in the âcentral fieldâ limited
by the gut cÃ¦ca; the vitellaria, on the other hand, are, as a rule,
external to the gut cÃ¦ca in the âlateral fields.â</p>

<p>The male apparatus<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> is composed of two variously formed
testes (fig.&nbsp;127) (globular, oval, indented, lobed, or ramified), which
may lie side by side or one behind the other; from each testicle
a tube (vas efferens) originates; sooner or later, both tubes as a rule
unite to form the ejaculatory duct or vas deferens, which is frequently<span class="pagenum" title="221"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a></span>
enclosed in a muscular <span class="lowercase smcap">CIRRUS SAC</span>, or more rarely passes directly into
the genital pore. The cirrus, which is the thick muscular terminal
portion of the vas deferens, can be everted and protruded from the
cirrus sac and serves as an organ of copulation. The walls of the
muscular portion of the tube (the cirrus) are attached to the walls of
the cirrus sac, and hence when the sac contracts the cirrus cannot
be protruded except by evagination of its lumen. Opening into the
middle portion of the vas deferens, and as a rule enclosed in the cirrus
sac, is found a mass of unicellular glands (prostate), the vesicula
seminalis (which is likewise within, or may also be outside the sac)
being the dilated first portion of the vas.</p>

<p>The female genitalia (fig.&nbsp;126) consist of an ovary, usually situated
in front of the testes, the form of which varies according to the
species, the usually double vitellaria, the ducts and a number of
auxiliary organs; the short oviduct directed towards the centre
arises from the ovary, and is connected in the median line with
the excretory duct of the vitelline glands. These grape-like glands
possess longitudinal excretory ducts, which assume a transverse
direction behind the ovary, unite together at the median line and
form a single duct, often dilated into a vitelline receptacle, that unites
with the oviduct. Near this point, moreover, there frequently opens
a canal (Laurerâs canal) which begins on the dorsal surface, and
on the inner end of which a vesicle filled with sperm (receptaculum
seminis) usually occurs (fig.&nbsp;126). Moreover, there are also numerous
radial unicellular glands (shell glands) at or beyond the point of
junction of the oviduct, vitelline ducts and Laurerâs canal. In this
portion of the duct (oÃ¶type), which is usually dilated, the ovarian
cells are fertilized, surrounded with yolk cells and shell material,
and as ova with shells they pass into the uterus (a direct continuation
of the oviduct), which, with its many convolutions, occupies a
larger or smaller portion of the central field, and runs either direct
to the genital pore or, forming convolutions, first runs posteriorly
and then bends forward (descending and ascending limbs). In both
cases the terminal part lies beside the cirrus pouch and discharges
beside the male orifice either on the surface of the body or into a
genital atrium. The terminal portion of the uterus, which is often
of a particular structure, serves as a vagina (<span class="lowercase smcap">METRATERM</span>).</p>

<p>The cirrus sac may include (1) the genital atrium (<i>i.e.</i>, the
common sinus, into which the vas deferens and vagina may open),
or (2) a variable extent of the vas from cirrus to seminal vesicle. Thus
the latter may be outside the sac. In the absence of a sac, the genital
sinus may be surrounded by a pseudo-sucker, as in <i>Heterophyes</i> (in
some cases the ventral sucker itself, from its close proximity to the
genital pore, serves as an accessory copulatory organ). In other cases<span class="pagenum" title="222"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></span>
copulatory organs are formed by hooks projecting into the lumen
of the terminal portion of the vas.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">GENITAL PORE</span>, which is the opening from the genital sinus on
to the surface, is generally situated at or near to the median line on
the ventral surface and in the anterior region of the body; in most
of the <i>Distomata</i> it is in front of the ventral sucker, in other cases,
<i>e.g.</i>, in the <i>CryptocotylinÃ¦</i>, it is behind.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<p>The spermatozoa do not differ essentially in their structure from
those of other animals; the ovarian or egg cells are cells without
integument and contain a large nucleus and a little protoplasm; the
vitellaria also produce nucleated cells, in the plasm of which there
are numerous yellow yolk granules; the yolk cells detach themselves,
like the ovarian cells, from the ovarium, and pass into the oviduct
to surround each ovarian cell in the oÃ¶type. They disintegrate sooner
or later in the completely formed egg and are utilized as food by the
developing embryo.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Development of the Trematodes.</span></h5>

<p>(1) <i>Copulation.</i>&mdash;Observation has demonstrated that the one or
two vaginÃ¦ occurring in the ectoparasitic Trematodes are utilized
as female organs of copulation, and that the copulation is cross;
it is also known that Laurerâs canal, which was formerly generally
regarded as the vagina, has only quite exceptionally, if at all, served
the digenetic Trematodes as such&mdash;it appears to be homologous with
the canalis vitello-intestinalis of the <i>Monogenea</i><a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a>&mdash;but the terminal
portion of the uterus, termed the metraterm, is used for copulation.
Cross-copulation occurs as well as auto-copulation and auto-fecundation.
The spermatozoa subsequently pass through the entire uterus,
which is still quite short at the time the male organs are matured; the
maturation of which, as usually is the case in hermaphrodites, precedes<span class="pagenum" title="223"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span>
that of the female organs. It is only later with the onset of egg formation
that the uterus is fully developed. Copulation, however, takes place
also in the case of fully grown forms with completely developed uteri.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>(2) <i>Formation of the Ova.</i>&mdash;The ovarian cells arising from the ovary
first become mature after their entry into the oÃ¶type by the formation
of three polar bodies, fertilization then taking place. At the same
time as the ovarian cell a number of yolk cells from the vitellarium
and secretion, drop by drop, from the shell gland reach the oÃ¶type.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a>
The shell is then formed during the generally active contractions of
the oÃ¶type walls and then passes on into the uterus. In the uterus of
the endoparasitic trematodes the eggs accumulate more and more,
often in large quantities, while in ectoparasitic species generally only
one or some few eggs can be found. The completed ova are of
various forms and sizes. They are mostly oval, at all events in the
digenetic trematodes, and the yellowish or brown shell is provided
with an opening at one pole which is closed by a watch-glass-shaped
lid (operculum). Appendages (filaments) on the shell&mdash;at one or both
poles&mdash;are uncommon, but are the rule in the ova of the <i>Monogenea</i>
(ectoparasitic species).</p>

<p>(3) <i>Deposition of the Ova.</i>&mdash;Soon after their formation, the
<i>Monogenea</i> (ectoparasitic trematodes) deposit round the place of<span class="pagenum" title="224"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span>
their attachment on the skin or the gills or other organs of their
hosts, eggs which attach themselves by means of their filaments.
The embryonic development thus takes place outside the parent.
This also holds good for the eggs of many endoparasitic species,
although as a rule in these the eggs are always retained for a
longer time in the uterus. Moreover, they usually here undergo a
part or a whole of their development, and are eventually deposited
in those organs in which the adult forms are parasitic, but this is
not always the case, as the egg, <i>e.g.</i>, of <i>F. hepatica</i> appears in bile (and
fÃ¦ces) quite unchanged. By the natural passages they eventually get
out of the body, and in cases where such do not exist, as in the case
of the blood-vessels, the eggs pass out by means of the kidneys.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The embryonic development</i>, after irregular segmentation of the
ovum into a number of blastomeres, leads to the formation of a solid
blastosphere or morula, which is surrounded by a cellular investing
membrane (yolk envelope), while the principal mass of the cells forms
the embryo, which uses for its nourishment the yolk cells, which have
in the meantime disintegrated (<i>cf.</i> footnote, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_223">223</a>). Usually, after
the ova have reached water the embryos hatch out, leaving the yolk
envelope in the egg-shell; in other cases, however, the embryos only
hatch out after having been subjected to the influence of the intestinal
juices, that is to say, in the intestine of an intermediate host which has
ingested with its food the ova that have escaped from the primary host.</p>

<p>(5) <i>The post-embryonic development</i> of the Trematodes is accomplished
in various ways; the process is the most simple in the ectoparasitic
species (<i>Monogenea</i>), the young of which should certainly
be regarded as larvÃ¦, because they possess characteristics (cilia,
simple gut, etc.) that are lacking in the adult worms, but which,
nevertheless, pass into the adult state direct after a relatively simple
metamorphosis. In the <i>Holostomata</i>,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> a group found chiefly in the
intestine of aquatic birds, and which rarely occur in other vertebrates,
the ova develop in water. The young are ciliated all over, and, after
having entered an intermediate host (leeches, molluscs, arthropods,
amphibians, fishes) living in the water, they undergo a metamorphosis
into a second larval stage; they then encyst and await transmission
into the final host, where they become adult Metastatic
trematodes, <i>i.e.</i>, trematodes without asexually produced generations
(p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_229">229</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>In the remaining so-called digenetic trematodes (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_230">230</a>) one or two
asexual generations interpose between the miracidium and terminal
stage, so that quite a number of adult worms may originate from
one egg. Usually the young, which are termed <span class="lowercase smcap">MIRACIDIA</span><a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> (fig.&nbsp;129),<span class="pagenum" title="225"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>
hatch in water, where they move with the aid of their cilia. Sooner
or later they penetrate into an intermediate host, which is always
a snail or a mussel, and while certain of their organs disappear,
they grow into a gutless germinal tube (<span class="lowercase smcap">SPOROCYST</span>, fig.&nbsp;131). These
are simple elongated sacs with a central body cavity. They may or
may not have excretory tubules. In these, according to the species,
the larval stages (<span class="lowercase smcap">CERCARIÃ</span>) that will ultimately become adult worms
are produced, or another intermediate generation is first formed, <i>viz.</i>,
that of the <span class="lowercase smcap">REDIÃ</span><a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> (figs.&nbsp;132, 133), which are always provided with an
intestine, and these then give rise to cercariÃ¦ (figs.&nbsp;130, <a href="#Fig_134">134</a>). The
cercariÃ¦, as a rule, leave their host and move about in the water
with the assistance of their rudder-like tails. After a little time, however,
they usually again invade an aquatic animal (worms, molluscs,
arthropods, fishes, amphibians), then they lose their tails and become
encysted (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_135">135</a>); here they wait until they attain, together with
their host, the suitable terminal host, and in this new situation they
establish themselves and reach maturity. Or, again, the cercariÃ¦ may
themselves encyst in water or on foreign bodies (plants) and wait until
they are taken up directly by the terminal host, <i>e.g.</i>, sheep.</p>

<p>Accordingly the following conditions are necessary for the completion
of the entire development: (1) The terminal host in which
the adult stage lives; (2) an intermediate host into which the
miracidia penetrate and in which they become sporocysts; (3) a
second intermediate host in which the cercariÃ¦ become encysted.
In certain species, as in <i>Fasciola hepatica</i>, this second host is omitted,
as the cercariÃ¦ spontaneously encyst on plants, or again (in other
species) encystment may occur within the first intermediate host, when,<span class="pagenum" title="226"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span>
in fact, the cercariÃ¦ (which in this case do not acquire an oar-like tail)
do not swarm out of, but encyst themselves within their sporocysts.
The development, moreover, may be further complicated by rediÃ¦
appearing in addition to the sporocysts, though this occurs in the
first intermediate host and not in a second one.</p>

<p>Animals that harbour adult digenetic Trematodes thus become
infected by ingesting encysted cercariÃ¦, which either occur (1) in
certain animals (second intermediate hosts) on which they feed, or
(2) in water, or (3) on plants, or finally (4) in the first intermediate
host; whereas animals harbouring encysted cercariÃ¦ have been directly
infected by the corresponding tailed stage, and animals harbouring
germinal tubes (sporocysts or rediÃ¦) have been infected by the
miracidia.</p>

<p>Thus certain species of ducks and geese become infected with

<i>Paludina</i>) in which the encysted cercariÃ¦ occur. Oxen become infected
with <i>Paramphistomum cervi</i> (= <i>Amphistomum conicum</i>) by swallowing
with water, cysts of this species which occur at the bottom of puddles
and pits. Sheep are infected with <i>Fasciola hepatica</i> by eating grass
to which the encysted cercariÃ¦ of the liver-fluke are attached; our
song-birds infect themselves or their young with <i>Urogonimus macrostomus</i>
by tearing off pieces containing the corresponding sporocysts
which are full of encysted cercariÃ¦ from snails (<i>Succinea amphibia</i>),
which act as the first intermediate hosts, and eating, or offering their
young these pieces.</p>

<p>(1) The <span class="lowercase smcap">MIRACIDIA</span> of the digenetic Trematodes are comparatively
highly organized, and the mode of their formation from the<span class="pagenum" title="227"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span>
segmentation cells of the ovum is only imperfectly known. They have
a cuticular epithelium (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_129">129</a>) entirely or partly covered with cilia,
beneath this a dermo-muscular tube composed of circular and longitudinal
muscles; also, a simple gut sac with an Åsophagus, occasionally
also with pharynx, salivary glands and boring spine, also
a cerebral ganglion on which, in some species, there are eyes
(fig.&nbsp;131, <i>a</i>). As to the excretory organs, they are represented by two
symmetrically placed terminal flame cells, with excretory vessels
opening separately; there is a
more or less ample (primary) body
cavity between the parietes of the
body and the gut; from the cellular
parietal lining of this cavity
single cells (germ cells) become
free (fig.&nbsp;131, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>), and become
rediÃ¦ or cercariÃ¦.</p>

<p>[The germ cells of the miracidium
and the germ balls of the
sporocyst arise, according to some
observers, by further division of
undifferentiated blastomeres; according
to others from the cells of
the lining wall of its body cavity.
It is from these free germ balls
that the redia stage is developed.</p>

<p>[In the germ ball or morula
appears an invagination, giving
rise to the cup-shaped gastrula
stage. This elongates and forms
the <span class="lowercase smcap">REDIA</span> (fig.&nbsp;131, <i>c</i>).</p>

<p>[In the interior of the redia
cells are budded off and develop
into gastrulÃ¦, as in the case of the
sporocyst. These become a fresh
generation of rediÃ¦ or give rise
to the third stage (<span class="lowercase smcap">CERCARIA</span>).]</p>

<p>(2) The <span class="lowercase smcap">SPOROCYSTS</span>, on the contrary, which are produced direct
from the miracidia, are very simple, as all the organs of the latter
disappear, even to the muscles and excretory organs, during or after
penetration into the intermediate host, whereas the budded and still
budding cells of the wall of the (primary) body cavity continue to
develop rapidly and form germ balls. The sporocysts when fully
developed have the appearance of tubes or fusiform bodies with
rounded edge; they are frequently of a yellow colour. Their length<span class="pagenum" title="228"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>
rarely exceeds a few millimetres; in some species their size increases
exceedingly through proliferation, and they then occupy a large portion
of the body of the intermediate host.</p>

<p>(3) The <span class="lowercase smcap">REDIÃ</span> (figs.&nbsp;132, 133), on the other
hand, are more cylindrical and always have a
simple intestine of varying length, provided
with a pharynx; they likewise possess, situated
near the circular ridge, a âbirth poreâ which
serves for the exit of the cercariÃ¦ originating
within them.</p>

<p>(4) The <span class="lowercase smcap">CERCARIÃ</span><a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> are very different; typically
they consist of the anterior body and the
oar-like tail at the posterior end (fig.&nbsp;134). The
former, even to the genitalia, has the organization
of the adult digenetic Trematodes, and
thus allows the easy recognition of at least the
characters of that large group to which the
species in question belongs. On the other
hand, however, there are also organs that are
lacking in the adult form, such as, in many, the
boring spine in the oral sucker, or the eyes
situated on the cerebral ganglion; moreover,
also, cutaneous glands (fig.&nbsp;134), the secretion of
which forms the cyst membrane. The oar-like
tail may be long or short (stumpy-tailed cercaria)
or entirely absent; its free end may be
partly split (furcate cercaria), or split to its base
(<i>bucephalus</i>); in various forms also the anterior
end of the tail is hollow, and has enclosed
within it the anterior body, which is otherwise
free. The size also of the cercaria belonging
to the different species is very diverse; in
addition to forms swimming in the water that
have the appearance of minute milky-white
bodies, there are forms which measure as much
as 6&nbsp;mm. in length.</p>

membrane, which may be striated or contain granules. The tail is
always cast off when encystment occurs, and organs peculiar to the
cercaria stage (boring papilla, eyes) almost entirely disappear. On
the other hand, the genitalia appear or become more or less highly
developed, in extreme cases to such an extent that they become
functional, and after autocopulation the creatures produce ova within
the cysts.</p>

<p>The cycle of development of the digenetic Trematodes has hitherto
been generally explained as a typical <span class="lowercase smcap">ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS</span>,
one sexual generation regularly alternating with one or two asexually
reproducing generations. Recent authors, however, regard the cells
in the sporocysts from which rediÃ¦ or eventually cercariÃ¦ arise as
parthenogenetically developing ova, and the sporocysts as well as the
rediÃ¦ as generations propagating parthenogenetically. In this case,
however, it is an alternation of a sexual not with an asexual but with
firstly a parthenogenetic generation (the sporocyst), the central cells
of which are regarded as ova which develop parthenogenetically into
the redia, and this the second parthenogenetic generation finally
produces larvÃ¦ (cercariÃ¦) capable of developing into the sexually
mature form.</p>

<p>Other authors, again, regard the development of the Digenea as
only a complicated metamorphosis (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_283">283</a>), which is distributed over
several generations before it is concluded.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Biology.</span></h5>

<p>Endoparasitic Trematodes, as fully developed organisms, occur in
vertebrate animals only, with very few exceptions; they inhabit almost
all the organs (with the exception of the nervous and osseous systems
and the male genitalia), but by preference the intestine in all its
extent from the oral cavity to the anus; and, further, certain species
or groups inhabit only quite restricted parts of the intestine. Besides
in the intestine other species live in the liver, or in the bile-ducts,
or in the gall-bladder; other accessory organs of the intestine, such
as the pancreas, bursa Fabricii (of birds), are only infected by a few
species. Many inhabit the lungs, or the air sacs in fowls, a few
the trachea. Trematodes have also been known to occur in the
urinary bladder, the urethra and the kidneys of all classes of
vertebrates; they are also present in the vascular system of a few
tortoises, birds and mammals; in birds they even penetrate from
the cloaca into the oviducts, and are occasionally found enclosed in
the laid eggs; one species is known to occur in the cavum
tympani and in the Eustachian tube of a mammal (Dugong),
another in the frontal sinus of the polecat; several species infest the<span class="pagenum" title="230"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span>
conjunctival sac under the membrana nictitans of birds, one species
even lives in cysts in the skin of song-birds. In an analogous manner
the ectoparasitic Trematodes are not entirely confined to the surface of
the body or the trachea of the lower vertebrate animals; a few species
appear exclusively in the urinary bladder, in the Åsophagus, and in the
case of sharks in an accessory gland of the rectum.</p>

<p>Trematodes live free and active within the organs attacked,
though they may attach themselves by suction for a longer or shorter
period; in other cases, however, they bore more or less deeply
into the intestinal wall with their anterior end, or lie in cysts
of the intestinal wall which only communicate with the lumen
through a small opening; in those species living in the lungs of
mammals the host likewise produces a cyst, which usually encloses
two specimens; such association of a pair is also observed in
other situations, and, though this is the rule in species sexually
distinct, it is not entirely confined to these.</p>

<p>As regards the <span class="lowercase smcap">AGE</span> attained by endoparasitic Trematodes, there
are but few reliable records, and these differ considerably; the
overwhelming majority of species certainly live about a year, or
perhaps a little longer, but there are some whose term of life
extends to several or many years.</p>

<p>Trematodes are but rarely found encysted in the higher vertebrate
animals; the condition, however, is more frequent in amphibians,
and especially in fishes, as well as in numerous invertebrate
animals.</p>

from Japan, China, and Tonkin (Gaide, two

<p>The liver fluke, however, is by no means a
harmless parasite, for it produces in domestic
animals, more especially in sheep, a disease of the liver that appears
epidemically in certain years and districts, and commits great ravages
amongst the flocks.</p>

<p>[The following records show the enormous loss caused in sheep
by this parasite. In 1812, in the Midi, principally in the Departments
of the RhÃ´ne, Herault, and Gard, the disease was rampant; 300,000
sheep perished in the Arles territory, and 90,000 in the Arrondissements
of NÃ®mes and Montpellier. In 1829 and 1830, in the Department<span class="pagenum" title="239"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span>
of the Meuse and near localities, not only sheep but oxen died in
enormous numbers; for instance, in the Arrondissement of Verdun
out of 50,000 sheep 20,000 died, and out of 20,000 cattle 2,200 died.
In England, in 1830, 2,000,000 sheep were carried off; whilst in 1862
60 per cent. of the sheep died in Ireland; and in 1879 over 300,000
were lost in England; whilst as late
as 1891 one owner in the same
country lost over 10,000 sheep (<i>Live

</div>

<p>The disease usually commences
towards the end of summer with an
enlargement of the liver, induced by
the invasion of numerous young
flukes; in the autumn and winter the
animals suffer from the consequences
of disordered biliary secretion; they
become feverish, emaciated, and
anÃ¦mic, and lose their appetite.
In consequence of the consecutive
atrophy of the liver, Ådema and
ascites set in, and many animals succumb to this âliver rot.â On
examination the liver is found to be shrunken, the bile-ducts are
enormously dilated and in parts saccular and full of flukes. Should
the animals survive this stage, spontaneous recovery ensues in
consequence of the flukes commencing to leave the liver in the<span class="pagenum" title="240"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span>
spring, but the liver remains changed and its sale is prohibited<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> when
the changes are extensive.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<p>[The following stages may be noticed in sheep suffering from
fascioliasis. Gerlach recognized four stages, based on the varied
relations that the flukes contract with the liver of their host. These
periods are sometimes very marked, but at others, owing to subsequent
infections, the features become merged and so obliterated. But
when a single infestation occurs they are very marked.</p>

<p>[The first period is called the
<span class="lowercase smcap">PERIOD OF IMMIGRATION</span>. This
occurs at the fall of the year and
generally passes unperceived, as
the young flukes do little harm
to the liver. It varies from four
to thirteen weeks. Gerlach has
remarked upon cases of death
from apoplexy at this period.</p>

<p>[The second period is the
<span class="lowercase smcap">PERIOD OF ANÃMIA</span>. This occurs
in November and December.
The sheep at first fatten rapidly,
but later the mucous membranes
become pale and of a yellowish
hue, and the sheep become sluggish and cease to feed. The fÃ¦ces
are normal, but may contain fluke ova.</p>

<p>[The third period is the <span class="lowercase smcap">PERIOD OF WASTING</span>. This corresponds
with the beginning of January&mdash;about three months after the<span class="pagenum" title="241"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span>
entry of the larvÃ¦. Emaciation now becomes very marked, the
skin and mucous membranes blanched, temperature variable and
marked by an irregular curve; respiration laboured and quick;
appetite regular; abortion frequently occurs in pregnant ewes;
pressure on the back causes the animals to fall; local Ådemas
occur, the most perceptible in the submaxillary space, extending
below the larynx and over the cheeks and parotids (called
âbourse,â âbouleâ in France; âwatery pokeâ or âcockeredâ in
England). Death usually occurs at this period, but a fourth
stage may occur.</p>

<p>[The fourth period is the <span class="lowercase smcap">PERIOD OF MIGRATION OF THE
FLUKES</span>. This is a period of convalescence and recovery, generally
in May and June.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

<p>Oxen suffer less in general, but even in these animals âstrayâ
hepatic flukes are occasionally found in the lungs, enclosed in thick-walled
cysts.</p>

<p><i>Pathological Anatomy.</i>&mdash;The bile-ducts are conspicuous on the
surface of the liver. They are thickened and much dilated and in
parts saccular, and considerable atrophy of the liver cells accompanies
the condition. Histologically there is immense proliferation
of the epithelium of the bile-ducts leading to âadenomata.â</p>

</div>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">LIFE-HISTORY</span> of the liver fluke was discovered by
R. Leuckart and P. Thomas. According to these investigators the
elongated miracidium (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_131">131</a>, <i>a</i>) ciliated all over develops from the
eggs a few weeks after the latter (fig.&nbsp;142) have reached the water, and
after it has become free the embryo penetrates and becomes a sporocyst
(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_131">131</a>, <i>b</i>) in a water-snail (<i>LimnÃ¦us truncatulus</i>, MÃ¼ll. =
<i>L. minutus</i>, Drap.) that is common in fresh water, and can live in the
smallest collection of water as well as in fields that have been flooded.
The sporocyst first of all produces rediÃ¦, which remain in the same
host (and under certain circumstances, <i>e.g.</i> in summer, these develop a
second generation of rediÃ¦), and these finally form cercariÃ¦ (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_134">134</a>).
The latter become encysted on blades of grass and are taken up by
the respective hosts with their food; this takes place towards the
end of summer, while the sheep feeding on the pasture land in the
spring spread the eggs of the fluke, and sometimes the fluke itself,
by passing them with their fÃ¦ces.</p>

<p>In districts where <i>LimnÃ¦us truncatulus</i> is absent, analogous
species act as the intermediary hosts, of which one example
according to Lutz is <i>LimnÃ¦us oahuensis</i> in the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>[The host in Europe is <i>LimnÃ¦us truncatulus</i>. This snail
extends from Siberia to Sicily and Algeria, and according to
Captain Hutton is a native of Afghanistan. It also occurs in<span class="pagenum" title="242"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span>
Thibet, Amoor, Morocco, Tunis, Canary Islands and the Faroe
Islands. It deposits its eggs or spawn upon the mud around ponds,
ditches and streams. The eggs are laid in batches of thirty to a
hundred, each snail laying as many as 1,500 eggs; they are united
into strips of a gelatinous substance. In about two weeks young
snails appear. It is amphibious, being more frequently met with out
of the water than in it. It occurs in elevated spots as well as in
low-lying districts. Moquin-Tandon found it at 4,000 feet in the
Pyrenees. In the allied species, <i>L. peregra</i>, the fluke will develop
up to a certain stage, but never completes all its varied phases.</p>

<p>[In South America the host is probably <i>LimnÃ¦us viator</i>, Orb.,
and in North America <i>LimnÃ¦us humilis</i>, Say.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

<p>In human beings as well as in some of the mammals quoted
above, the liver fluke is only a casual parasite, and hitherto only
twenty-eight cases have been observed in man; the infection was
mostly a mild one and there were no symptoms, or only very
trifling ones; a few isolated cases were only discovered <i>post mortem</i>.
Occasionally, however, even when the infection was inconsiderable,
severe symptoms were set up, which in isolated cases led to death.
The symptoms (enlargement and painfulness of the liver, icterus)

<p>In North Lebanon, the liver fluke is, according to A. Khouri,
a frequent parasite of man, not in the liver, however, but in the
pharynx. The occurrence in this unusual site
is effected by the eating of raw infected livers,
especially those of goats (<i>Capra hircus</i>). The
flukes thus taken in do not all reach the
stomach, where they would be soon killed, but
some of them attach themselves to the pharyngeal
mucosa and to the adjoining parts, and
there cause inflammation and swelling, which
lead to dyspnÅa, dysphagia, dysphonia and
congestion of the head, sometimes even to
still more severe symptoms, and even death.
The affection termed âHalzounâ lasts some
hours or several days, and after vomiting
recovery sets in. In other cases man becomes
infected in the usual way by ingesting cysts attached to grass or
the underside of leaves of plants (<i>e.g.</i>, Rumex sp.), where they<span class="pagenum" title="243"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>
are overlooked from
their scanty size (0Â·2 to
0Â·3&nbsp;mm.).</p>

<p>As the liver fluke
feeds on blood it is
possible that it also
reaches, particularly
when young, the circulatory
system, and cases
have been known in
which it has been carried
by the blood into organs
far from its original situation.
Such cases also
have been repeatedly
observed in men. Probably
the parasite described
by Treutler,
1793, as <i>Hexathyridium
venarum</i>, which protruded
from the ruptured
anterior tibial vein
of a man, was a young
liver fluke. A few adult
specimens were found
by Duval in the portal
and other veins <i>post
mortem</i> at Rennes (1842)
in a man, aged 49, and
a similar statement is
reported by Vital from
Constantine (1874).
Giesker, in 1850, found
two hepatic flukes in a
swelling on the sole of
the foot of a woman.
Penn Harris states that
he observed six specimens
in Liverpool in a
spontaneously ruptured
abscess of the occiput
of a two months old
infant. Another case
which, like the previous<span class="pagenum" title="244"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span>
one, is reported by Lankester,<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> relates to a sailor who suffered from
an abscess behind the ear, and from which a liver fluke was expelled.
Finally, Dionis de CarriÃ¨res reports the case of a man, aged 35, in
whose right hypochondriac region a tumour the size of a pigeonâs egg
had formed, and from which a young liver fluke was extracted.</p>

<p>From such records it is not impossible that <i>Distomum oculi
humani</i>, Ammon, 1833, as well as <i>Monostomum lentis</i>, v. Nordm.,
1832, may have been very young hepatic flukes that had strayed.
Ammon found four specimens (length 0Â·5 to 1&nbsp;mm.) of his species
(named <i>Distomum ophthalmobium</i> by Diesing in 1850) between the
opaque lens and the capsule of a five months old child in Dresden,
and von Nordmann discovered his <i>Monostomum lentis</i> to the number
of eight specimens (only 0Â·3&nbsp;mm. in length) in the opaque lens of
an old woman. Minute white bodies which Greef found in the cortex
of the lens of a fisherman, aged 55, removed on account of cataract,
were with some reserve regarded as Trematode larvÃ¦. The fact that
Ammon found that the intestinal cÃ¦ca of the worm discovered by
him had no lateral branches does not negative the above opinion, as
in the liver fluke the intestinal cÃ¦ca are originally unbranched, and
according to Lutz they only develop lateral ramifications later, between
the twelfth and twenty-second day of infection (fig.&nbsp;144).</p>

long, characterized by its slender aspect and by the size of its ventral
sucker, and its close proximity to the oral sucker. Considering the
fact that Gouveaâs patient had spent many weeks in July of the same
year in Dakar (Senegambia), where according to Railliet <i>Fasciola
gigantica</i> is common in slaughtered animals, and considering also
the characters of the fluke, Railliet rightly assumes that one had to
do with the African giant fluke and that the patient had infected
himself in Dakar.</p>

(Mathis and LÃ©ger). Skin without
spines, but according to Heanly
always present in man and pig
specimens. The oral sucker
measures 0Â·5&nbsp;mm. in diameter;
the ventral sucker is three to four
times as large; the pharynx is
globular, 0Â·7&nbsp;mm. in diameter;
the prepharynx is provided with a
sphincter; the intestinal cÃ¦ca extend

two characteristic curves, one at the anterior border of the anterior
testis, the other between the two testes. The genital pore is at the
anterior border of the ventral sucker; the cylindrical cirrus pouch
extends from behind the ventral sucker to half-way to the shell gland.
The seminal vesicle extends forwards within the cirrus pouch as a
convoluted tube. From its anterior portion is given off the cÃ¦cal
appendage, which has itself short lateral diverticula.
It runs backwards, ending blindly
about 0Â·5&nbsp;mm. from the posterior end of the
cirrus sac. The seminal vesicle is continued as
the pars prostatica (?) 0Â·5&nbsp;mm. long, and this
by the very short ejaculatory duct (13&nbsp;Âµ), and
finally by the fairly long cirrus, which is beset
with very fine spines except at either extremity.
The ovary and shell gland are situated at about
the middle of the body with the testes behind
them, and the uterus in front. The vitellaria
extend from the ventral sucker to the posterior
border. The eggs measure 120&nbsp;Âµ to 130&nbsp;Âµ in
length and 77&nbsp;Âµ to 80&nbsp;Âµ in breadth, and resemble
those of Echinochasma sp. in dogs. The larval
stages are said to occur in shrimps.</p>

tissue into which the worms have wandered.
The worms and their eggs cause bronchitis
and peribronchitis, catarrhal, hÃ¦morrhagic, or
purulent, and areas of consolidation. Areas
containing eggs in their centre resembling
tubercle nodules are not uncommon, and
extensive cirrhosis of the lung may be found.
As a result of these changes, emphysema and bronchiectasis also
occur.</p>

<p>As to the development, only the following details are known:
that the eggs, which before segmentation of the ovum reach the open
in the sputum and through being swallowed also in the fÃ¦ces,
develop in water into a miracidium ciliated all over, which hatches
and swims about freely. According to Manson this takes place in
four to six weeks.</p>

<p>This parasite is yellowish-red in the fresh condition, and almost
transparent. The body is flat, with a conical neck at the level of the
ventral sucker marked by a shallow constriction; this, however,
is only noticeable in fresh and somewhat contracted specimens.
Posteriorly to the ventral sucker the lateral borders run fairly parallel;
the posterior end is either pointed or rounded off. The length and
breadth vary according to the contraction, being usually 8 to 11&nbsp;mm.
by 1Â·5 to 2&nbsp;mm. The suckers are about one-fifth to one-sixth of
the length of the body distant from each other, and of about
equal size (0Â·23 to 0Â·25&nbsp;mm.). The Åsophagus is hardly any longer
than the pharynx, which lies close behind the oral sucker; the
intestinal cÃ¦ca reach almost to the posterior border and are often
filled with blood. The excretory pore is at the posterior extremity,
and the excretory bladder forks in front of the anterior testis. The
testes in the posterior fourth of the body lie obliquely one behind
the other; the anterior one has four lobes, the posterior one five
lobes; the ovary is in the median line transversely, simple or
slightly lobed; behind it lies the large pear- or retort-shaped receptaculum
seminis and Laurerâs canal. The uterus is in the median field.
The vitellaria occupy the fairly broad lateral areas, in about the
central third of the body, beginning behind the ventral sucker and
terminating at about the level of the ovary; the acini are small and
arranged in groups of seven to eight, separated by interstices. The
genital pore is close in front of the ventral sucker. The eggs are
oval with sharply defined operculum at the pointed pole, 30&nbsp;Âµ, by 11&nbsp;Âµ.</p>

<p>This species, which is frequently confused with others, inhabits the gall-bladder
and bile-ducts of the domestic cat especially; but is also found in the
dog, in the fox, and in the glutton (<i>Gulo borealis</i>). It has been observed in
France, Holland, North Germany (being particularly frequent in East Prussia), in
Russia, Scandinavia, Siberia, Japan, Tonkin, Hungary, and Italy. The North
American form (from cats and <i>Canis latrans</i>) is a distinct species (<i>Opisthorchis
pseudofelineus</i>).</p></div>

<p>In man this species was first found by Winogradoff in Tomsk (nine
cases), then by Kholodkowsky in a peasant from the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum" title="253"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></span>
of Petrograd who had travelled a
great deal in Siberia, and finally by
Askanazy in five persons who were
natives of the East Prussian district of
Heydekrug. In Tomsk, <i>Opisthorchis
felineus</i> is the most frequent parasite
of man that comes under observation
at <i>post mortem</i> (6Â·45 per cent.), whereas
<i>TÃ¦nia saginata</i> has only been found
in 3Â·2 per cent., Echinococcus in 2Â·4 per
cent., <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> in 1Â·6 per
cent., and <i>Oxyuris vermicularis</i> in 0Â·8
per cent. of the autopsies. In the district
of Heydekrug, however, the species in
question is also frequent, as in a few
years five cases came to our knowledge
(of which three were diagnosed by the
discovery of the eggs in the fÃ¦ces).</p>

<p>In none of Winogradoffâs nine cases
had the death of the patient been caused
direct by the parasites, yet more or less
extensive changes in the liver were
found in all of them; such as dilatation
of the bile-ducts with inflammation and
thickening of their walls, and foci of
inflammation or atrophy in the liver
substance; icterus was present five
times and atrophy of the liver an equal
number of times; ascites
was observed three times,
and in two cases, probably
of recent date, the organ
was enlarged. The number
of parasites found
fluctuated between a few
and several hundreds.</p>

<p>In two of Askanazyâs
cases, which he examined
more closely, carcinoma
which had developed at
the places most invaded by flukes was found at the <i>post-mortem</i>, so
that perhaps there may be grounds for the connection which the author
seeks to establish between cancer of the liver and the changes induced
by the parasites; these changes consist of numerous and even ramified<span class="pagenum" title="254"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a></span>
proliferations of the epithelium of the
biliary duct into the connective
tissue, which is likewise proliferated.
The number of worms found in one
case amounted to over 100; in a
second case, in which the parasites
had also invaded the pancreatic duct,
their number was even larger.</p>

<p>Winogradoff as well as Askanazy
found isolated flukes in the intestine
also.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, nothing much is
known of the history of the development
of <i>Opisthorchis felineus</i>; we only
know that when deposited the eggs
already contain a ciliated miracidium,
which, however, according
to my experience, does not hatch out
in water, but only after the entry of
the eggs into the intestine of young
<i>LimnÃ¦us stagnalis</i>; no further development,
however, occurs. Winogradoff
states that he has seen the
miracidia hatch after the eggs had
been kept in water for a month at
37Â°&nbsp;C.; and has even observed free
miracidia in the bile of man and of
a dog respectively. Although the
whole post-embryonal development
of the cat fluke remains yet to be
investigated, Askanazy by a series of
experiments on cats and dogs has discovered
the mode of infection. The
intermediate hosts are fish, and
mainly the ide, in this country called
Tapar (<i>Idus melanotus</i>, H. and Kr.),
and of subsidiary importance the<span class="pagenum" title="255"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a></span>
roach (<i>Leuciscus rutilus</i>). Both species of fish as well as others are
readily eaten raw by man on the Courland lagoon (Baltic). It is, moreover,
significant that those persons whom Askanazy found infected
with the cat fluke were also infected with <i>Dibothriocephalus latus</i>, the
intermediate host of which is also fish (Lota sp., Esox sp., Perca sp.).</p>

<p>In one of his nine cases Winogradoff also saw a small fluke
covered all over with spines, which he conjectured to be the young
stage of <i>Opisthorchis felineus</i>; as, however, according to my experience,
this species, even in smaller specimens, is always without spines,
the above hypothesis cannot be accepted. It is much more probable
that one of the other species that also invade the liver of cats may
accidentally be introduced into man; we know, in fact, that <i>Metorchis
albidus</i>, Braun, and <i>Metorchis truncatus</i>, Rud., are both covered with
spines. As, however, the spines of the first-named species are rather
apt to fall off, and also as it possesses a different shape (spatula-shaped),
it may be assumed that probably Winogradoff had found <i>Metorchis
truncatus</i>, Rud., 1819, in his patient.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;This species occurs very frequently in man, in
certain districts of Japan, especially in the province of Okayama,
Central Japan, in particular localities of which above 60 per cent. of
the population are infected. The worms are sometimes found in
enormous numbers in the liver (upwards of 4,000), also in the
pancreas and rarely in the duodenum.
It is common in Tonkin
and Indo-China. LÃ©ger in Tonkin
found 50 per cent. of people apparently
in normal health infected,
so that probably symptoms only
arise when the infection is intense.

<p>Verdun and Bruyant deny, in
opposition to Looss, the possibility
of being able to distinguish within
the genus Clonorchis the two species
described, but they admit the justification
for the new genus. They
also report the occurrence of <i>Opisthorchis
felineus</i> in man in Tonkin
(<i>Compt. Rend. Soc. de Biol.</i>, lxii, 1907).</p>

<p><i>Pathology.</i>&mdash;Both species of Clonorchis
give rise to grave symptoms. The liver is generally enlarged,
though when the infection has lasted some time it begins to contract.
The surface of the organ is studded with white vesicles, and on cutting
into it one sees numerous
cavities with thickened
walls (distended
bile-ducts) filled with a
brownish fluid containing
innumerable eggs,
which cause its colour.
Microscopically, the epithelium
of the bile-ducts
is either (1) entirely destroyed,
or (2) actively
proliferates, forming an adenomatous outgrowth. Occasionally this
proliferation is not limited by the wall of the bile-duct but penetrates
it and leads to a growth of numerous new ducts, forming a<span class="pagenum" title="261"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span>
malignant biliary adenoma. The bile-ducts have their connective
tissue wall greatly sclerosed. These fuse with one another, forming
areas of sclerosis devoid of liver tissue. As a result of these changes
the liver cells atrophy and undergo fatty pigmentary and granular
degeneration. Besides these changes, due probably to the toxic action
of the flukes, mechanical obstruction due to the actual plugging of the
ducts by the flukes causes retention of bile and icterus, and through
pressure on veins, ascites and hypertrophy of the spleen.</p>

<p>To what extent blood or bile respectively forms the food of the
flukes is uncertain.</p>

<p>It results from the work of Kobayashi in Japan that fresh-water fish
form the <i>second</i> intermediate host for <i>Clonorchis endemicus</i>. He fed
cats with encysted flukes (cercariÃ¦) from various fish and easily
succeeded in infecting them, <i>e.g.</i> a kitten, proved to be uninfected by
repeated examination of its fÃ¦ces, was fed on infected fish; a month
later innumerable flukes were found in the bile-ducts, gall-bladder,
pancreas and even in the duodenum. The fish infected were <i>Leucogobis
gÃ¼ntheri</i>, <i>Pseudorasbora parva</i>, and to a less extent <i>Acheclognathus
lanceolata</i>, <i>Acheclognathus limbata</i>, <i>Paracheclognathus rhombea</i>, <i>Pseudoperilampus
typus</i>, <i>Abbottina psegma</i>, <i>Biwia zezera</i> and <i>Sarcocheilichthys
variegatus</i>. The cysts occur throughout the muscles and subcutaneous
tissue of the fish. Length 0Â·13&nbsp;mm., breadth 0Â·1&nbsp;mm. The cercaria
lies folded in the cyst, length 0Â·5&nbsp;mm. breadth 0Â·1&nbsp;mm. It tapers
posteriorly. Skin at first covered with fine spines, disappearing as they
grow older. Body dotted with fine pigment.</p>

<p>This species, which attains a length of 2&nbsp;mm., is slender and conical,
the anterior end is pointed and the posterior truncated, and provided
with a muscular tuberosity that resembles a terminal sucker; for this
reason the discoverer of the species (Rudolphi) classed it with the
Amphistomes. The cuticle in the young, as well as in the adult
specimens, is entirely and closely covered with spines. Suckers about
equal in size (0Â·134 to 0Â·172&nbsp;mm.); the ventral sticker lies somewhat<span class="pagenum" title="262"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></span>
in front of the middle of the body. The pharynx is small (0Â·09&nbsp;mm.),
the Åsophagus minute, the intestinal cÃ¦ca reach to the posterior
extremity. Between them, and in front of
their blind ends, lie the two elliptical testes,
one generally a little in front of the other.
In front of them, either in the median
line or somewhat laterally, the spheroidal
ovary is situated; in front, again, is the
uterus, the coils of which usually extend
beyond the median field. The vitellaria
are at the sides of the central third of the
body, thus commencing in front of the
ventral sucker; cirrus pouch absent; the
genital pore is close in front of the
acetabulum. The excretory pore is terminal
(?). Eggs 29&nbsp;Âµ by 11&nbsp;Âµ.</p>

<p><i>Metorchis truncatus</i> lives in the bile-ducts
of the seal, cat, dog, fox, and
glutton (<i>Gulo borealis</i>). The source of
infection is unknown, although one would
suspect fish. Askanazy did not succeed
in getting this fluke in his feeding experiments,
but another species, <i>Metorchis
albidus</i>, not uncommon in cats by feeding
them on roach (<i>Leuciscus rutilus</i>).</p>

<p>Length up to 2&nbsp;mm., breadth 0Â·4&nbsp;mm.; the neck not sharply defined;
in life it stretches to double the length of the hind body. The scales
are rectangular, 5&nbsp;Âµ to 6&nbsp;Âµ by 4&nbsp;Âµ, their posterior margin serrate with
seven to nine teeth. Cuticular glands are numerous on the ventral
surface, especially in the fore part of the body, and partly discharge
at the anterior border of the oral sucker. The oral sucker is 0Â·09&nbsp;mm.,
the ventral sucker 0Â·23&nbsp;mm. in diameter; the pharynx measures
0Â·05 to 0Â·07&nbsp;mm. in length;
the Åsophagus is about
three times as long; posteriorly
the intestinal cÃ¦ca
are directed one towards
the other and terminate
beside the excretory
bladder. Close in front
of the posterior ends of
the intestinal branches are
the two elliptical testes,
which are not exactly on
the same level. In the
middle in front of them is
the receptaculum seminis,
and in front of the latter
lies the spherical or elliptical
ovary. The two vasa
efferentia unite to form the
vas deferens, which after
a short course passes over
into the angularly bent
seminal vesicle; after the
entry of the prostatic
glands it becomes united
with the metraterm
(vagina), and the common
duct opens into the genital
sucker. The latter is somewhat
smaller than the ventral
sucker, lateral to and
close (0Â·15&nbsp;mm.) behind it, and bears a not entirely closed ring of
from seventy-five to eighty chitinous rods (20&nbsp;Âµ in length). The vitellaria
on either side consist of about fourteen acini. The uterus is
spread almost throughout the entire posterior part of the body. The
eggs have thick shells with a knob resembling that of Clonorchis eggs
but not so prominent, and measure 30&nbsp;Âµ by 17&nbsp;Âµ; they contain a
completely ciliated miracidium with a rudimentary intestinal sac.</p>

<p>This species was discovered in 1851 by Bilharz in the intestine
of a boy who died in Cairo; a second case was only found in 1891
and published by R. Blanchard, so that it appeared as if the species
were very scarce. According to Looss, this is, however, not the case,
but the species easily escapes notice on account of its small size.
Looss found it in Alexandria twice in nine autopsies, and once in
Cairo, and has recently stated that in man âit is not at all uncommon
to meet with the parasite in cadavers, and the eggs of the worm in
the stools of the patients.â Leiper records one case from Japan
and one from China. The parasites occupy the middle third of the
small intestine, and even when present in large numbers appear to be
harmless.</p>

<p>This small species, according to
Looss, frequently occurs in Egyptian
dogs, less so in cats, and has also been
found in the fox, as well as once in
<i>Milvus parasiticus</i>; Janson also reports
this species from the intestine of the
dog in Japan.</p>

and peculiar 0Â·12 to 0Â·14&nbsp;mm. by 0Â·08 to 1&nbsp;mm. It is a sac-like
organ placed deeply in the body, but does not open as in other flukes on
the ventral surface. Testes elliptical, not quite symmetrically placed at
the hind end of the body. Vesicula seminalis retort-shaped, situated
transversely, internal to the ventral sucker. Pars prostatica present.<span class="pagenum" title="265"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a></span>
Ejaculatory duct opens with the uterus into a genital sinus, which,
together with the internal opening of the ventral sucker, opens into a
pit at the front of the ventral sucker. The opening of the genital sinus
and that of the ventral sucker are furnished with a complex muscular apparatus.
Ovary spherical, 0Â·12 to 0Â·13&nbsp;mm. in diameter, lies in the middle
of the hind body. Receptaculum seminis and Laurerâs canal present.
Vitellaria in the hind half of the body, consisting of about ten acini on
each side. Shell gland to the left of the
ovary. Uterus forms three to four transverse
coils. Eggs elliptical, double
contoured, yellowish-brown in colour.

<p>Body lancet-shaped, narrowing especially at the anterior extremity;
length 8 to 10&nbsp;mm., breadth 1Â·5 to 2Â·5&nbsp;mm., the greatest breadth usually
behind the middle of the body. Suckers distant from each other by
about one-fifth the length of the body; oral sucker about 0Â·5&nbsp;mm., ventral
sucker about 0Â·6&nbsp;mm. Pharynx globular, adjoining the oral sucker;
Åsophagus 0Â·6&nbsp;mm. in length; intestinal cÃ¦ca reach to four-fifths of
the body length. Genital pore at the level of the bifurcation of the
intestine; cirrus pouch small and slender. The large, slightly lobed
testes lie obliquely one behind the other behind the ventral sucker;
the ovary, which is considerably smaller, is placed behind the posterior
one; the vitellaria, commencing at the level of the posterior
testis, terminate far before the cÃ¦ca. The uterus, situated behind the
ovary, extends throughout the posterior end, not confined to the central
field, but overlapping the lateral fields with its transverse coils; at
the posterior edge of the body it turns back again and winds forwards
to the ovary in transverse loops, then between the testes, and finally,
dorsal to the ventral sucker, terminates in the genital pore. The
thick-shelled eggs when young are yellowish, when older dark brown.
They measure 38&nbsp;Âµ to 45&nbsp;Âµ by 22&nbsp;Âµ to 30&nbsp;Âµ. They contain an oval or
roundish miracidium, only the anterior part of which is ciliated, and
which possesses a rudimentary intestinal sac with a boring spine.
The miracidia do not hatch out in water spontaneously, but, according
to Leuckart, in the intestines of slugs (<i>Limax</i>, <i>Avion</i>), but they
do not develop either in these (slugs) or in water-snails.</p>

<p>The lancet fluke inhabits the biliary duct of herbivorous and
omnivorous mammals (sheep, ox, goat, ass, horse, deer, hare, rabbit,
pig), and is often found associated with the liver fluke; it is not,
however, so common nor so widely disseminated, nevertheless, it has
been met with outside of Europe, namely, in Algeria, Egypt, Siberia,
Turkestan, and North and South America.</p>

<p>In man it is still more uncommon than the liver fluke, and has
hitherto only been observed seven times (Germany, Bohemia, Italy,
France, and Egypt); it may, however, have occurred more frequently,
and have been overlooked, as in slight infections it produces no
special symptoms.</p>

<p>The intermediate host is still unknown. Leuckart for some time
held the opinion that small species of <i>Planorbis</i> from fresh water,
which contain encysted Distomata, were to blame, and he supported
his views by a feeding experiment which seemingly yielded positive
results; this, however, is not definitely proved. Pianaâs statement
that small land snails are the intermediate hosts has also not been

<p><i>The Male</i> is whitish, 12 to 14&nbsp;mm. in length, but is already mature
when 4&nbsp;mm. long. The anterior end is 0Â·6&nbsp;mm. or a little over in
length. The suckers are near
each other, the oral sucker is infundibular,
and the dorsal lip is
longer than the ventral one. The
ventral sucker is a little larger,
0Â·28&nbsp;mm., and is pedunculated.
A little behind the ventral sucker
the body broadens to a width of
1&nbsp;mm., decreasing, however, in

ventrally, so that the posterior

<p><i>The Female</i>&mdash;filiform, about 20&nbsp;mm. in length, pointed at each end,
and measuring 0Â·25&nbsp;mm. in diameter in
the middle. Their colour varies according
to the condition of the contents of
the intestine. (Posteriorly they are dark
brown or blackish.) The cuticle is smooth
except in the sucker, where there are very
delicate spines, and at the posterior end,
where there are other larger spines. The
oral sucker is a little larger than the
pedunculated ventral sucker (0Â·07 and
0Â·059&nbsp;mm. respectively). The anterior
part of the body, 0Â·2 to 0Â·3&nbsp;mm. in length;
the Åsophagus is as in the male. The
intestinal bifurcation is in front of the
ventral sucker, the two branches uniting
behind the ovary and the trunk running
in a zigzag manner to the posterior border.
There are indications of diverticula at the
flexures. The ovary is median. In young
females it is of an elongated oval shape;
in older females the posterior end becomes
club-shaped, whereas the anterior end
becomes attenuated; the oviduct originates
at the posterior end, but immediately
turns forwards and joins the parallel
vitelline duct in front of the ovary (fig.&nbsp;174),
where the shell gland cells open; the
common canal becomes dilated to form
the oÃ¶type, and then proceeds as the
uterus, with only slight convolutions,
along the central field to the genital pore,
which lies in the middle line immediately
behind the ventral sucker. The single
vitellarium starts behind the ovary and
extends to the posterior end. The acini
are situated at the sides of the excretory
duct, which runs a median course. The eggs are compact spindles,
much dilated in the middle; they have no lid, and are provided with a
terminal spine (rudimentary filament) at the posterior end, measuring
120&nbsp;Âµ to 150&nbsp;Âµ in length and 40&nbsp;Âµ to 60&nbsp;Âµ in breadth, but vary in size

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;In order to understand the distribution of the worms
and eggs in the body, it may be well to recall the blood supply of the
abdominal and pelvic organs. It is generally assumed that the early
life (? cercarial stage) of the worms occurs in the liver, and that the
young worms travel from here, where they are invariably found, to
their various sites along the portal vein and its tributaries and so
<i>against</i> the blood stream. The tributaries of the portal vein <span class="nowrap">are:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) <i>Superior mesenteric</i>, the tributaries of which are: (<i>a</i>) the veins
of the small intestine; (<i>b</i>) ileo-colic; (<i>c</i>) right colic; (<i>d</i>) middle colic;
(<i>e</i>) right gastro-epiploic; and (<i>f</i>) inferior pancreatic. By these paths
infection of the small intestine, ascending and transverse colon and
pancreas would occur.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Splenic.</i> (Ova have been recorded by Symmers in the spleen.)</p>

<p>(3) <i>Inferior mesenteric</i>, the tributaries of which are (<i>a</i>) superior
hÃ¦morrhoidal veins from the upper part of the hÃ¦morrhoidal plexus;
(<i>b</i>) sigmoid veins from sigmoid flexure and lower portion of <i>descending</i>
colon; (<i>c</i>) left colic vein draining descending colon.</p>

<p>The superior hÃ¦morrhoidal veins form a rich plexus in the rectum,
and below this level in the upper and middle parts of the anal canal.
The plexus forms two networks, an <i>internal</i> plexus in the submucosa
and an external on the outer surface. The <i>internal</i> plexus opens at
the anal orifice into: (<i>a</i>) branches of the inferior hÃ¦morrhoidal vein
(from the pudic); (<i>b</i>) the external plexus. The <i>external</i> plexus gives
off: (<i>a</i>) inferior hÃ¦morrhoidal opening into internal pudic (of <i>internal
iliac</i> vein); (<i>b</i>) mid-hÃ¦morrhoidal into <i>internal iliac</i> or its branches;
and (<i>c</i>) superior hÃ¦morrhoidal opening into inferior mesenteric.
The external plexus further communicates with the vesico-prostatic
plexus. The vesico-prostatic (vaginal) plexus opens into the <i>vesical
veins</i>, which drain into the interior iliac vein. This plexus also
receives afferents from the pudendal plexus, the chief tributary of
which is the dorsal vein of the penis. The pudendal plexus also
receives branches from the inferior pudic and the anterior surface of
the bladder.</p>

<p>There is thus a communication between the portal vein and the
vena cava by means of these plexuses, <i>viz.</i>, through the inferior and
middle hÃ¦morrhoidals, and by the inferior hÃ¦morrhoidals to the
bladder and thence by the vesical veins or the pudic to the caval
system (interior iliac).</p>

<p>It is thus by the inferior mesenteric and its tributaries that the
worms reach the descending colon, rectum, anal canal, and eventually
the bladder, and in some cases the caval system.</p>

<p>Before considering what is actually found <i>post mortem</i> in these
veins and the organs drained by them, we may further recall the fact
that the calibre of âmediumâ veins is 4 to 8&nbsp;mm., âsmallâ veins<span class="pagenum" title="273"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a></span>
less than 40&nbsp;Âµ in diameter and capillaries 8&nbsp;Âµ to 20&nbsp;Âµ. Further, the
maximum diameter of the male worm is 1&nbsp;mm., that of the female
280&nbsp;Âµ and eggs <i>in utero</i> 80&nbsp;Âµ to 90&nbsp;Âµ long by 30&nbsp;Âµ to 40&nbsp;Âµ.</p>

<p><i>Liver and Portal Vein.</i>&mdash;Here worms are most easily found <i>post
mortem</i>. Often only males are found and these of the same size,
and if females occur only a few worms are found in copulÃ¢. The
worms are frequently not full size and the males may contain no free
spermatozoa in their testes, and as regards the females some may
be fertilized, others not, as shown by the presence or absence of
spermatozoa in the seminal receptacle or uterus. In either case they
may contain eggs&mdash;<i>lateral-spined</i>&mdash;usually one, less often two, but
there may be as many as five or six. These eggs may also show
some abnormality, which takes the form of: (1) abnormal contents,
<i>viz.</i>, disintegrating yolk cells with or without an ovarian cell;
(2) abnormal shape but with normal contents and probably represented
by the collapsed and empty egg-shells which are found in the
tissues.</p>

<p>As to the interpretation of these facts, Looss believes that these
lateral-spined eggs are products of young females whose egg-laying
is not at first properly regulated. The shape that the eggs take, <i>viz.</i>,
with a lateral spine, is determined by an excess of material&mdash;ovarian
and yolk cells&mdash;being present in the oÃ¶type. The shape of eggs
depends upon the position they have in the oÃ¶type during their
formation. In young females an excess of cells&mdash;yolk cells especially&mdash;accumulates,
distending not only the dorsal wall but a portion also
of the short duct joining the oÃ¶type to the uterus. The result of this
is that the axis of the oÃ¶type and egg is almost transverse to the body,
and the posterior funnel-shaped portion of the oÃ¶type, instead of
being terminal, has now a lateral or rather a ventral position, so that
the spine which occupies this portion, instead of being terminal, is
now lateral. It is noteworthy that these lateral-spined eggs are
thicker, owing to the excess of material present, and not uncommonly
have a curved anterior border, due to a projection of the anterior end
into the anterior opening of the oÃ¶type.</p>

<p>As these eggs are being laid by females in the portal vein they are
carried back to the liver by the blood stream. The liver is one of
the commonest sites for these eggs; also terminal-spined eggs may be
found here for the same reason.</p>

<p><i>HÃ¦morrhoidal Veins.</i>&mdash;Mature worms, generally in copulÃ¢, are
usually found here, though young not fully grown females may also
occur. The tissues of the rectal wall (or colon) show, as a rule, large
quantities of lateral-spined eggs, though less often only terminal-spined
eggs may be found.</p>

<p><i>Vesico-prostatic Plexus.</i>&mdash;Worms in copulÃ¢ are found in the veins<span class="pagenum" title="274"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a></span>
of the submucosa in the bladder, and the eggs in the mucosa, and
those voided are usually terminal-spined, though lateral-spined eggs
are not so rare as generally thought. The problem next arises as to
how the eggs get to the lumen of the gut or bladder.</p>

<p>The female worm is 280&nbsp;Âµ in diameter. Veins in the submucosa
of the rectum less than 178&nbsp;Âµ in diameter are not affected with endophlebitis.
It is probable that the female even by stretching could not
penetrate much beyond this. Eggs are probably then laid in the
submucosa as near the muscularis mucosa as possible. Now if the
eggs are laid in a vein of larger calibre than the worm fills, the eggs
would be carried back to the inferior mesenteric vein, so that presumably
the worm must succeed in blocking the vein already narrowed
by endophlebitis, so that by the stasis which ensues the eggs may
escape from the veins. How this occurs is not exactly known; it is
not necessarily due to the spine, as the same escape into the tissues
occurs in spineless eggs, such as those of <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i>. The
eggs, then, pass as foreign bodies through the tissues. Another hypothesis
is that the worms leave the veins in order to lay their eggs,
but the evidence is against this.</p>

<p><i>Caval System.</i>&mdash;Occasionally worms that have passed through the
vesical plexus may be found in the iliac vein, inferior vena cava,
and even the lungs. If the worms are young they contain a lateral-spined
egg; if adult, numerous (50 to 100) terminal-spined eggs.</p>

<p><i>Lungs.</i>&mdash;When the liver is strongly infected with (terminal-spined)
eggs it is possible that by passive movements some may pass into the
intralobular veins, and thence by the inferior vena cava to the lungs.</p>

<p><i>Gall-bladder.</i>&mdash;Similarly terminal-spined eggs pass into the bile-capillaries
and gall-bladder (where they may be abundant), and so into
the fÃ¦ces.</p>

<p><i>Detection of Eggs.</i>&mdash;Occasionally eggs may be found in various other
parts of the body. They are best detected by macerating pieces of the
tissue in question in about <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> per cent. hydrochloric acid at 50 to 60Â°C.
(Looss).</p>

<p>Pathological <span class="nowrap">changes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Rectum.</i>&mdash;These have been studied thoroughly by Letulle in the
case of an apparently pure infection of the rectum.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> They take the
form of a chronic diffuse inflammation, which may result in&mdash;(1) ulceration,
or (2) hyperplasia of the mucosa, producing adenomata.</p>

<p><i>Ulcerative Form.</i>&mdash;The <i>mucosa</i> is transformed into a mass of
vascular connective tissue. The connective tissue spaces next become
invaded by numerous mononuclear cells. The tissue itself<span class="pagenum" title="275"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></span>
undergoes diffuse sclerosis, becoming hard and fibroid. Eventually
ulcerative necrosis sets in. During these changes the LieberkÃ¼hn
glands are destroyed. The process does not extend to the submucosa,
in this respect differing from that in chronic dysentery.</p>

<p><i>Hyperplastic Form.</i>&mdash;The LieberkÃ¼hn glands of the mucosa at first
hypertrophy; then there is an actual hyperplasia resulting in adenomata.
The interstitial tissue of the glands is also greatly hypertrophied,
giving rise to very vascular granulations. These growths
are often hollow and contain worms. Many eggs are found in the
mucosa on their way to the lumen of the gut.</p>

<p>The <i>muscularis mucosa</i> is thickened up to twice or even ten times
the normal. Its vessels are dilated (36&nbsp;Âµ to 80&nbsp;Âµ), but they do not
allow of the passage of worms.</p>

<p>The <i>submucosa</i> is profoundly changed; rigid and hard instead of
supple. It is here that the greatest number of eggs occur. A remarkable
condition of endophlebitis exists in the veins of the
submucosa, not only in the smaller ones but also in the larger ones
(370&nbsp;Âµ by 270&nbsp;Âµ). This endophlebitis results in a more or less complete
occlusion of the vessels of the lumen.</p>

<p>The <i>muscular coats</i> are free from change, also their veins.</p>

<p>The <i>Serous Coats</i>.&mdash;The veins about 1,900&nbsp;Âµ, also show endophlebitis.
Besides the rectum, in extreme cases even the transverse colon, the
cÃ¦cum and small intestine may be affected.</p>

<p><i>Bladder.</i>&mdash;In the early stages the mucosa is deep red and swollen
like velvet, or there may be localized patches of hyperÃ¦mia or
extravasation. The subsequent changes take two chief <span class="nowrap">forms:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) <i>Sandy Patches.</i>&mdash;The mucosa looks as if it were impregnated
with a fine brownish or yellowish powder (myriads of ova). This is
accompanied by a gradual hypertrophy and new formation of connective
tissue, so that dry, hard or plate-like patches with this sandy
appearance arise; the thickening eventually affects all the coats of
the bladder. In the older patches many of the eggs are calcified.
These patches sooner or later break down, ulcerate and necrose.
Phosphatic deposits are abundant and stone is common. These
patches are not found in the rectum.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Papillomata.</i>&mdash;Where the inflammatory change produced by
the eggs gives rise to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the mucosa,
papillomata result, the axis of which is formed by connective tissue
of the submucosa. These are most variable in shape and form and
bleed readily, and sometimes contain cavities of extravasated blood.</p>

<p>As in the rectum, it is in the submucosa that eggs are most
abundant, and worms in copulÃ¢ occur in the veins of this layer, but
endophlebitis is not as general as described in the rectum. Malignant
disease of the bladder is not an uncommon sequela of bilharziasis.<span class="pagenum" title="276"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a></span>
Besides the bladder, the ureters and kidneys may in advanced cases
be involved. The prostate and vesiculÃ¦ seminales are commonly
diseased. Eggs have been recorded in the semen. The urethra is
frequently attacked; the vagina in the female.</p>

<p>Eggs also occur in the lymphatic glands of the gut.</p>

<p><i>Geographical Distribution.</i>&mdash;East Africa:

Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The means by which infection is brought
about are still uncertain; we only know that
the miracidia (fig.&nbsp;175) enclosed in the discharged
eggs do not hatch if the eggs remain
in the urine, but after cooling perish. As
soon, however, as the urine is diluted with
water the shell swells, generally bursting lengthways,
and releases the miracidium from its
investing membrane, so that it can swim about
with the aid of its cilia. In its structure it
differs but little from the miracidium of <i>Fasciola
hepatica</i>, as, for instance, in the lack of eyes;
the two large gland cells situated on either side of the intestinal
sac are also present in the miracidia of <i>Fasciola hepatica</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sarcode Globules.</i>&mdash;This is a term applied to certain globules which at
times appear in the miracidium and are later ejected. Some authors<span class="pagenum" title="277"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a></span>
consider them as indicative that the miracidium has developed into
a sporocyst, but Looss considers them to be degeneration products.</p>

<p>The Bilharzia mission, under R.&nbsp;T. Leiper, sent to Egypt by the
War Office early in 1915, reports that cercariÃ¦ of bilharzia type were
recognized in four of the commonest fresh-water molluscs around
Cairo.</p>

<p>With material obtained from naturally infected <i>Planorbis boissyi</i>
acute bilharziosis was experimentally produced in rats, mice, and
monkeys. Infection takes place experimentally through the skin and
also through the mucous membrane of the mouth and Åsophagus.
The miracidium, after entering the mollusc, develops into a sporocyst.
This gives rise not to rediÃ¦, but to secondary sporocysts, which, in
turn, produce cercariÃ¦. These, like the adult worm, differ from other
distomes in lacking a muscular pharynx.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Schistosoma mansoni</b>, Sambon, 1907.</p>

<p>According to Manson, Sambon and others, the eggs with lateral
spines belong to a species different from <i>Schistosoma hÃ¦matobium</i>.
Infections with this species only are said to
occur in the Congo, Southern States of North
America, West Indies (Guadeloupe) and Brazil
(Bahia). The following characters, according to
Flu, differentiate this species: (1) In the male
the transition from the anterior portion of the
worm to the lateral fields (the infolded portions
which form the gynÃ¦cophoric canal) is not a
gradual one as in <i>Schistosoma hÃ¦matobium</i>,
but in this case the lateral fields rise suddenly,
almost at right angles to the anterior portion.
(2) The ovaries have a well-marked convoluted
course as in no other schistosome. (3) The
oÃ¶type is symmetrical in reference to the long
axis of the body, its duct being lateral on the
ventral side (Loossâ explanation of this we have
already given). (4) The worms live exclusively
in portal vein and tract. (As lateral-spined eggs
occur also in the bladder, this is not exactly true.)</p>

ducts enter at the junction point of

here forms an oÃ¶type and then proceeds
as the uterus to open directly behind
the ventral sucker. The uterus occupies
almost half the hind-body. In <i>S. hÃ¦matobium</i>
this is not so. The uterine canal

contoured. In fÃ¦ces the eggs measure 83Â·5&nbsp;Âµ, by 62Â·5&nbsp;Âµ (man); 85&nbsp;Âµ

small lateral spines or thickenings, and Looss at the opposite
side has described cap-like thickenings.
The eggs in the tissues undergo various deformities,
and may contain a miracidium, as
also the eggs in fÃ¦ces do; or the contents
may consist of granular matter or amorphous
masses or they may be calcified. Lymphocytes
and giant cells may also invade the

<p><i>Mode of Infection.</i>&mdash;The miracidia hatch
in water in as little as fifteen minutes, but
the majority in one to three hours. They will live in water for about
twenty-four hours. In water they undergo a transformation into
âlarvÃ¦,â which then penetrate the skin, as has been shown by
Japanese writers to hold good for man, cattle, dog and cat. The
penetration of the skin is attended with an eruption on the legs,
âKabure.â The exact route by which the worms reach the portal vein
is uncertain. Infection in Japan takes place from spring to autumn,
especially May to July, when the soil is contaminated with manure
of cattle infected with <i>S. japonicum</i>. They also appear to develop
in molluscs. Leiper and Atkinson found cercariÃ¦ (in sporocysts)<span class="pagenum" title="280"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a></span>
in the liver of a mollusc, <i>Katayama nosophora</i>. They infected mice
by immersing them in water containing liver emulsion and so free
cercariÃ¦, thus confirming the similar results of Miyairi and Suzuki.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&mdash;The worm occurs in Japan, China, and the Philippines.
The normal host is man and mammals. Cattle, dog and cat are
often found naturally infected. Mice can also be experimentally
infected. Their seat of election is the portal vein and its branches,
especially the mesenteric veins. They either
swim free in the blood or remain fixed by
their suckers to the intima of the vessels.
They have also been found in the vena cava
and right heart of a cat, but not so far in the
vesical plexus.</p>

<p>Eggs are found in the submucosa and

<h4>Class III. <b>CESTODA</b>, Rud., 1808.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tapeworms have been known from ancient times&mdash;at all events, the large
species inhabiting the intestines of man&mdash;and there has never been a doubt as
to their animal nature. The large cysticerci of the domestic animals (occasionally
of man also) have been known for an equally long period, but they were generally
regarded as growths, or âhydatids,â until almost simultaneously Redi in Italy, and
Hartmann and Wepfer in Germany, concluded from their movements and organization
that they were of animal nature. From that time the cysticerci have been
included amongst the other intestinal worms, and Zeder (1800) established a special
class (<i>Cystici</i>, Rud., 1808) for the bladder worms. Things remained in this condition
until the middle of the last century, when KÃ¼chenmeister, by means of successful
feeding experiments, demonstrated that the cysticerci were definite stages of
development of certain tapeworms. Before KÃ¼chenmeister, E. Blanchard, van
Beneden, and v. Siebold had held the same opinion in regard to other asexual
Cestodes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="283"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a></span></p>

<p>Since the most remote period another question has again and again occupied
the attention of naturalists, the question of the morphological nature&mdash;that of the
<span class="lowercase smcap">INDIVIDUALITY OF THE TAPEWORM</span>. The ancients, who were well acquainted
with the proglottids (<i>Vermes cucurbitani</i>) that are frequently evacuated, were
of the opinion that the tapeworm originated through the union of these separate
proglottids, and this view was maintained until the end of the seventeenth
century. In 1683 Tyson discovered the head with the double circlet of hooks in
a large tapeworm of the dog; Redi (1684) was also acquainted with the head and
the suckers of several TÃ¦niÃ¦. Andry (1700) found the head of <i>TÃ¦nia saginata</i>, and
Bonnet (1777) and Gleichen-Rusworm (1779) found the head of <i>Dibothriocephalus
latus</i>. Consequently most authors, on the ground of this discovery, considered the
tapeworm as a single animal, that maintains its hold in the intestine by means of the
head, and likewise feeds itself through it. The fact was recognized that there were
longitudinal canals running through the entire length of the worm, and it was thought
that these originated in the suckers, and that the entire apparatus was an intestine.
As, moreover, the segments form at the neck, and are cast off from the opposite
extremity, the tapeworm was also compared with the polyps, which were formerly
regarded as independent beings.</p>

<p>Steenstrup, in his celebrated work on the alternation of generations (1841), was
the first to give another explanation. This has been elaborated still further by
van Beneden, v. Siebold and Leuckart, and until a few years ago all authorities
adopted his views. According to this view, the tapeworm is composed of numerous
individuals, something like a polyp colony, and, in addition to the proglottids&mdash;the
sexual individuals which are usually present in large numbers&mdash;there is <span class="lowercase smcap">ONE</span>
individual of different structure, the <i>scolex</i>, which not only fastens the entire colony
to the intestine, but actually produces this colony from itself, and therefore is
present earlier than the proglottids. The scolex is a ânurse,â which, though itself
produced by sexual means, increases asexually like a <i>Scyphistoma</i> polyp; the
tapeworm chain has therefore been termed a <i>strobila</i>. Consequently the development
of the tapeworms was explained by an alternation of generations. In support
of this opinion it was demonstrated not only that the adult sexual creatures, the
proglottids, can separate from the colony and live independently for a time, but
that in certain TÃ¦niÃ¦, and especially in many Cestodes of the shark, the proglottids
detach themselves long before they have attained their ultimate size, and thus
separated continue to develop, grow and finally multiply; the scolex also exhibits a
certain independence in so far as, though not, as a rule, capable of a free life, yet
it in some cases lives as a free being, partly on the surface of the body of marine
fishes and partly in the sea. With the more intimate knowledge of the development
of the cysticerci, the independent nature of the scolex was recognized. It is
formed by a budding of the bladder that has developed from the oncosphere, in
some cases (CÅnurus) in large numbers, in other cases (Echinococcus) only after
the parent cyst has developed several daughter cysts. Released from its mother
cyst and placed in suitable conditions, it goes on living, and gives rise at its
posterior end by budding to the strobila, the proglottids of which eventually become
sexual individuals.</p>

<p>In order to make this clearer we will briefly summarize what takes place in
the jelly-fishes.</p>

<p>By <i>metamorphosis</i> is meant a developmental change in the <i>same</i> individual, while
alternation of generations, or <i>metagenesis</i>, implies a stage in which <i>reproduction</i> of
individuals takes place by a process of budding or fission. This <i>asexual</i> reproductive
stage <i>alternates</i> with the <i>sexual</i> mode of reproduction. Thus in the development
of the Scyphozoa (jelly-fishes) we <span class="nowrap">have:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) The fertilized egg cell divides regularly and forms a <i>morula</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="284"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a></span></p>

<p>(2) By accumulation of fluid in the interior this becomes a closed sac with a wall
formed of a single layer of cells, forming the <i>blastosphere</i> or <i>blastula</i>.</p>

<p>(3) One end of the sac is invaginated, forming a <i>gastrula</i>.</p>

<p>(4) The gastrula pore or mouth closes, forming again a sac, the walls of which
have two layers, forming a <i>planula</i>.</p>

<p>(5) This becomes fixed to a rock, an invagination forms at one end, a depression&mdash;the
stomodÃ¦um&mdash;communicating with the enteric cavity. Tentacles grow out
and we have a <i>ScyphozoÃ¶n polype</i>, <i>Scyphistoma</i> or <i>Scyphula</i>. It is to this stage that
Steenstrup gave the name ânurseâ (âwet-nurseâ), because it nourished or produced
asexually the succeeding forms.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Asexual reproduction</i> by transverse fission occurs in this, forming a pile of
saucer- or pine-cone-like animals which before this time had been considered to
be a distinct animal, which was called <i>strobila</i> from its resemblance to a pine-cone.
This is the alternate generation.</p>

<p>(7) The individuals of the strobila become free and are called <i>EphyrulÃ¦</i>.</p>

<p>(8) These develop finally into adult sexual jelly-fish, <i>Scyphozoa</i>, so that comparing
a tapeworm with this we have (<i>a</i>) egg, (<i>b</i>) scolex (= Scyphula or ânurseâ),
(<i>c</i>) asexual reproduction of the tapeworm chain (= strobila), (<i>d</i>) development of the
individuals of the chain (proglottids) into sexual adults.</p>

<p>Van Benedenâs terminology for these stages is the following: Ciliated embryo
= protoscolex; scyphistoma = deutoscolex (or scolex); free Ephyrula = proglottis.
According to this view, as is the case in many endoparasitic Trematodes, asexual
reproduction by budding occurs at two stages of the whole cycle of development,
<i>viz.</i> (1) in the formation of the scolex by budding from the bladder (ânurseâ),
(2) in the formation of the strobila by budding from the scolex (ânurseâ).</p>

<p>But in cysticercal larval forms it appears that the scolex does not arise in this
way but is simply a part of the proscolex (hexacanth embryo), becoming invaginated
into it for protection, so that there is no asexual gemmation here. It has been
questioned also whether the strobila also arises by gemmation. If it does, the
tapeworm is a <i>colony</i> of zoÃ¶ids produced by budding from the asexual scolex; if it
is not produced in this way, then the tapeworm is to be regarded as an <i>individual</i>
in which growth is accompanied by segmentation. Against the âcolonyâ view are
the facts that the muscular, nervous, and excretory systems are continuous throughout
the worm, and that some tapeworms, such as <i>Ligula</i>, are unsegmented.</p>

<p>Finally, if the tapeworm is an individual the question arises which is the head
end. As new segments are formed at the neck, and as this point in annelids is
the antepenultimate segment, the scolex must be the last or posterior segment. The
caudal vesicle or bladder of larval forms is consequently anterior. According to
this view, in tapeworms as among many endoparasitic flukes, an <i>asexual</i> multiplication
occurs at two points of the whole cycle of development, which is as follows:
(1) egg, (2) oncosphere or hexacanth embryo, (3) bladder (cysticercus or hydatid),
(4) (after digestion of the bladder) by budding, the scolex, (5) by budding from the
scolex the sexual proglottids, (6) the egg; (4) and (5) being the two asexual stages.</p></div>


<h5><span class="smcap">Anatomy of the Cestoda.</span></h5>

<p>If we except the tapeworms with only one proglottis, the
<span class="smcap">Cestoidea Monozoa</span>, Lang = <i>Cestodaria</i>, Monticelli, we can always
distinguish in the Cestodes, in the narrower sense, one scolex or head
and a large or small number of segments (proglottids). The <span class="lowercase smcap">SCOLEX</span>
serves the entire tapeworm for fastening it to the internal surface of the<span class="pagenum" title="285"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a></span>
intestinal wall, and therefore carries at its end various organs which
assist in this function, and which are as follows: (i) <span class="smcap">Suctorial
organs</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, the four suckers (acetabula), which are placed crosswise
at the circumference of the thickened end of the scolex; further, the
double or quadruple groove-like suckers (bothridia), which are
diversely shaped in the various genera and families.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> (2) <span class="smcap">Fixation
organs</span> (hooklets)<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> that likewise occur in varying numbers and
different positions; they may be in the suckers, or outside them on the
apex of the scolex; for instance, in many of the <i>TÃ¦niidÃ¦</i> they appear
in a circle around a single protractile organ, the rostellum, or the latter
may be rudimentary, and is then replaced by a terminal sucker.
(3) <span class="smcap">Proboscis.</span> One family of the Cestodes, the <i>RhynchobothriidÃ¦</i>,
carries four proboscides, moved by their own muscular apparatus,
on the scolex, and they are beset with the most diverse hooks.
(4) <span class="smcap">Tentacle-like</span> formations are only known in one genus
(Polypocephalus).</p>

<p>The thickened part of the scolex that carries the suckers is usually
called the head; the following flat (unsegmented) part connecting it
with the proglottids is called the neck, and is sometimes quite small.
In a few cases the entire scolex (or head) disappears, and its function is
then undertaken by the contiguous portion of the chain of proglottids,
which is transformed into a variously shaped <span class="lowercase smcap">PSEUDO-SCOLEX</span>.</p>

<p>The proglottids are joined to the scolex in a longitudinal row,
and are arranged according to age in such a manner that the oldest
proglottis is farthest from the scolex, and the youngest nearest to it.</p>

<p>The number of segments varies, according to the species, from
only a few to several thousands; they are either quadrangular or
rectangular; in the latter case their longitudinal axis falls either
longitudinal or transverse to that of the entire chain, according as
the segments are longer than broad or broader than long. When the
number of segments is very large, the youngest ones are, as a rule,
transversely oblong, the middle ones are squarish, and the mature
ones longitudinally oblong. The posterior border of the segments,
as a rule, carries a longitudinal groove for the reception of the shorter
anterior border of the following proglottis. The two lateral borders
of the segment are rectilinear, but converge more or less towards the
front, or they are bent outwards. In most of the Cestodes the
segments, just as the neck, are very flat; in rare cases their<span class="pagenum" title="286"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a></span>
transverse diameter is equal to their dorso-ventral diameter. As a
rule the segments, singly or several united together, detach themselves
from the posterior end, in many cases only after complete
maturity is attained, and in others much earlier; they then continue
to live near their parent colony, to still call it by that name, in the
same intestine and continue their development. Even when evacuated
from the intestine the proglottids under favourable circumstances
can continue to live and creep about, until sooner or later they
perish.</p>

<p>The first proglottis formed, and which in a complete tapeworm
[<i>i.e.</i>, sexually complete] is the most posterior, is as a rule smaller and
of different shape, it also frequently remains sterile, as likewise happens
in the next (younger) segments in a few species; otherwise, however,
sooner or later the generative organs develop in all the segments,
mostly singly, sometimes in pairs; in the latter case they may be quite
distinct from each other or possess some parts in common. The
term âmatureâ is used for a proglottid that has the sexual organs
fully developed, while âgravidâ is used for one containing eggs.
Most of the species combine male and female genitalia in the same
segment, only a few are sexually distinct (DiÅcocestus). In the
hermaphrodite species one male and one female sexual orifice are
always present, and, in addition, there may be a second female orifice,
the uterine opening; as a rule, however, this is lacking, and in one
sub-family, the <i>AcoleinÃ¦</i>, to which also the genus DiÅcocestus belongs,
the other sexual orifice, the opening of the vagina, is also absent.
The position of these orifices varies; the cirrus and vagina usually
open into a common atrium on one lateral border or on a surface
of the segments; the orifice of the uterus may be on the same
surface or on the opposite one.</p>

<p>The surface on which the uterus opens is termed the <span class="lowercase smcap">VENTRAL
SURFACE</span>; if this orifice is absent, one must depend on the ovary,
which almost always approaches one of the two surfaces; this surface
is then called the ventral.</p>

<p>The length of the Cestodes&mdash;independently of their age&mdash;depends
on the number and size of the segments, as well as on their
contraction; the smallest species (<i>Davainea proglottina</i>) is 0Â·5 to
1Â·0&nbsp;mm. in length; the largest may attain a length of 10&nbsp;m., and
even more.</p>

<p>The entire superficial surface of the tapeworms is covered with
a fairly resistant and elastic layer, which exhibits several indistinctly
limited layers and which is usually called a cuticle, which also covers
the suckers, and is reflected inwardly at the sexual orifices. In some
species fine hairs appear, either on the entire body or only in the
region of the neck, on the external surface. In the cuticle there can be<span class="pagenum" title="287"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a></span>
recognized, besides the pores, which no doubt are concerned with
nutrition, spaces in which lie the ends of sensory cells. Close under
the cuticle lies the external layer of the parenchyma (basal membrane),
and below this the circular and longitudinal muscles forming the
dermo-muscular coat. The matrix cells of the cuticle occur as in
the Trematodes, only on the
inner side of the peripheral
muscles in the external zone
of the parenchyma; they are
fusiform cells, forming one
or two layers, but are not
arranged in the manner of
epithelial cells (fig.&nbsp;184, <i>Sc.c.</i>).
They have fine branching
processes which run between
the dermal muscles, pass
through the basal membrane
and penetrate the internal surface
of the cuticle with small
pistil-like enlargements, expanding
on the internal
surface of the cuticle into
a thin plasma layer.</p>

<p>In addition to the above
mentioned, there are other
cuticular formations occurring
on the cuticle of some
Cestodes, such as immobile
hairs and variously formed
hooks, such as are seen principally
on the scolex. Their
development is only roughly
known in a few species; they
are usually already present in
the larval stage, and of the
same arrangement and shape
as in the fully developed
tapeworms; a matter of
importance, because by these
structures larvÃ¦ can be recognized
as being those of a certain species of tapeworm.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">CUTICULAR GLANDS</span> in Cestodes are scarce.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">PARENCHYMA</span> forms the chief tissue of the entire body, and in
all essentials its structure is similar to that of the Trematodes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="288"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a></span></p>

<p>The same doubt exists here also as to the nature of the parenchyma.
Recent authors consider that it consists of highly branched cells, the
processes of which ramify in all directions. These cells lie in a non-cellular
matrix containing fluid vacuoles. This matrix spreads in
between and so breaks the continuity of the epidermal cells.</p>

<p>In the parenchyma of almost all the Cestodes there are found in
adult specimens, as well as in larvÃ¦, light-refracting concentrically
striated structures, of a spherical or broad elliptical shape, which, on
account of their containing carbonate of lime, are termed <span class="lowercase smcap">CALCAREOUS
CORPUSCLES</span> (fig.&nbsp;184, <i>C.</i>). Their size, between 3&nbsp;Âµ and 30&nbsp;Âµ, varies
according to the species; their frequency and distribution in the parenchyma
also varies, but they are chiefly found in the cortical layer.
They are the product of certain parenchymatous cells, in the interior
of which they lie like a fat globule in a fat cell, but according to
others they are <i>intercellular</i> in origin.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">MUSCULAR SYSTEM</span> of the proglottids is composed of&mdash;(1) the
subcuticular muscles (figs.&nbsp;184 and 185), as a rule consisting of a
single layer of annular muscles; (2) longitudinal muscles; (3) dorso-ventral
fibres extending singly from one surface to the other, and
at both ends expanding in a brush-like manner, and inserted into
the basal membrane, consisting of an outer, more numerous, and an
inner, less numerous but more powerful layer (the number of bundles
in this layer being in certain cases of specific importance); (4) transverse
fibres, the elements of which penetrate to the borders of the segments,
thus passing through the longitudinal muscles and reaching<span class="pagenum" title="289"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a></span>
the cuticle. In the region of the septa the transverse and dorso-ventral
muscles form a kind of plate.</p>

<p>It was known long ago that the myoblasts adhere to the dorso-ventral
fibres as thickenings, but it is only recently that large star-shaped
cells (fig.&nbsp;184), separated from but connected with them by
processes, have been recognized as
the myoblasts of other fibres (Blochmann,
Zernecke).</p>

<p>Within the scolex the direction
and course of the muscular layers
change.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">SUCKERS</span> are parts of the
musculature, locally transformed,
with a powerful development of
the dorso-ventral muscles, now
become radial fibres.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">ROSTELLUM</span> of the armed
TÃ¦niÃ¦, like the proboscis of the
<i>RhynchobothriidÃ¦</i>, also belongs to
the same category of organs.</p>

<p>In the simplest form, the rostellum,
or top of the head (as
in <i>Dipylidium caninum</i>), appears
as a hollow oval sac, the anterior
part of which, projecting beyond
the upper surface of the head, carries several rows of hooks (fig.&nbsp;186).
The entire internal space of the sac is occupied by an elastic, slightly
fibrous mass, while the anterior half of the surface of the rostellum is
covered by longitudinal fibres and the posterior half by circular fibres.
On contraction of the latter the entire mass is protruded through the
apical aperture, the surface of the rostellum becomes more arched, and
the position of the hooks is, in consequence, altered. The rostellum
of the large-hooked <i>TÃ¦niidÃ¦</i>, which inhabit the intestine of man and
beasts of prey, is of a far more complicated structure, for, in addition
to the somewhat lens-shaped rostellum carrying the hooks on its outer
surface, there are secondary muscles grouped in a cup-like manner
(fig.&nbsp;187). Every change in the curvature of the surface of the rostellum
induces an alteration in the position of the hooks. In the hookless
<i>TÃ¦niidÃ¦</i> the muscular system of the rostellum is altered in a very
different manner; in a few forms a typical sucker appears in its place.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">NERVOUS SYSTEM</span> commences in the scolex and runs through<span class="pagenum" title="290"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a></span>
the neck and the entire series of proglottids. Within the proglottids
it consists of a number of longitudinal nerve fibres of which those at
each lateral border are usually the largest. In the TÃ¦niÃ¦ the lateral
nerves are accompanied both
dorsally and ventrally by a
thinner nerve (accessory nerve)
(fig.&nbsp;185); on each surface,
moreover, between the lateral
nerve and the median plane,
there are two somewhat
stronger bundles (sub-median),
so that there is a total of ten
longitudinal nerve bundles.
They lie externally to the transverse
muscle plates, and the
lateral and accessory bundles
lie externally to the principal
excretory vessels, and are everywhere
connected by numerous
anastomoses and secondary
anastomoses; one typical ring
commissure is usually found
at the posterior border of the
segments. In the <i>BothriocephalidÃ¦</i>
the distribution of
the nerve bundles is different
(for instance, two lie in the
medullary layer), or they are
split up into a larger number
of branches. In the scolex the nerve bundles are connected in a very
remarkable manner by commissures with that which is generally
termed the central part of the entire nervous system. There occurs
normally a commissure between the two lateral nerves; at the same
level, the dorsal and ventral median nerves are also connected at each
surface as well with each other as with the lateral nerves, so that a
hexagonal or octagonal figure is formed. The so-called apical nerves
pass from this commissural system anteriorly, embrace the secondary
muscular system of the rostellum semicircularly, and form an annular
commissure (rostellar ring) at the inner part of the rostellum.</p>

</div>

<p>The peripheral nerves arise from the nerve bundles as well as
from the commissures situated in the scolex; some go direct to the
muscles, while others form a close plexus of nerves external to the
inner longitudinal muscles, which plexus likewise sends out fibres to
the muscles, but principally to numerous fusiform sense organs<span class="pagenum" title="291"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a></span>
(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_184">184</a>, <i>Pl.</i>); they lie internal to the subcuticular cells and, piercing the
cuticle with their peripheral processes, end as projecting âreceptorâ
hairs. Higher organs of sense are not known.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">EXCRETORY APPARATUS</span> of the Cestodes is similar to that of
other flat worms. The terminal
(flame) cells, which hardly differ
in appearance from those of
the Trematodes, are distributed
throughout the parenchyma, but
are more common in the cortical
than in the medullary layer
(fig.&nbsp;184, <i>T.c.</i>). Before opening
into a collecting tube, the capillaries
run straight, tortuously,
or in convolutions, anastomosing
frequently with one another
or forming a <i>rete mirabile</i>. The
collecting tubes, which have
their own epithelial and cuticular
wall, and which also
appear to be provided with
muscular fibres, occur typically
as four canals passing through
the entire length of the worm
(fig.&nbsp;189); they lie side by side,
two (a wider thin-walled ventral,
and a narrower thick-walled
dorsal one) in either lateral field;
in the head the two vessels on
each side unite by means of a loop, at the posterior extremity they
open into a short pyriform or fusiform terminal bladder which discharges
in the middle of the posterior edge of the original terminal
proglottis.</p>

<p>This primitive type (fig.&nbsp;189) of arrangement of collective tubes is
subject to variation in most Cestodes, in the scolex as well as in the
segments. Indeed, even the lumen of the four longitudinal tubes
does not remain equal, as the dorsal or external tubes are more fully
developed and become thicker, whereas the ventral or internal ones
remain thin, and in some species quite disappear in the older segments
(figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_185">185</a>, 187). Moreover, very frequently connections are
established between the right and left longitudinal branches, as in the
head, where a âfrontal anastomosisâ develops, which in the <i>TÃ¦niidÃ¦</i>
usually takes the form of a ring encircling the rostellum (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_190">190</a>), and
in the segments of a transverse anastomosis at each posterior border,<span class="pagenum" title="292"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a></span>
especially between the larger branches, and more rarely between the
smaller collecting tubes also (fig.&nbsp;191).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The so-called âislandâ formation is another modification, <i>i.e.</i>,
at any spot a vessel may divide and after a longer or shorter course
the two branches reunite, and this may appear in the collecting tubes
themselves as well as in their anastomoses. The above-mentioned ring
in the frontal commissure of the <i>TÃ¦niidÃ¦</i> is such an island; similar
rings also frequently encircle the suckers (fig.&nbsp;190). In extreme cases
(<i>TriÃ¦nophorus</i>, <i>Ligula</i>, <i>Dibothriocephalus</i>, etc.) this island formation
extends to all the collecting tubes and their anastomoses. Instead of
two or four longitudinal canals only, connected by transverse anastomoses
at the posterior border of the segments, there is an irregular
network of vessels, situated in the cortical layer, from which the
longitudinal branches, having again subdivided, can only be distinguished
at intervals, and even then not in their usual number.</p>

<p>The opening of the longitudinal branches at the posterior end
requires more accurate investigation; it is true that a single terminal
bladder is mentioned as being present in many species, but this is
also disputed; when the original end proglottis has been cast off, the
longitudinal branches discharge separately. Some species possess the
so-called foramina secundaria, which serve as outlets for the collecting
tubes; they are generally at the neck, but may be situated on the
segments.</p>

<p>The contents of the excretory vessels is a clear fluid, the regurgitation
of which is prevented by the valves present at the points of
origin of the transverse anastomoses. The fluid contains in solution
a substance similar to guanine and xanthine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="293"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Genital Organs.</i>&mdash;With the exception of one genus (<i>DiÅcocestus</i>,
Fuhrm.), in which the species are sexually differentiated, all the
Cestodes are hermaphroditic; the genitalia develop gradually in
the segments (never in the scolex), the male organs, as is usual
in hermaphroditic animals, forming earlier than the female. The
youngest proglottids generally do not exhibit even traces of genitalia:
these, as a rule, develop first in the older segments, and the development
proceeds onwards from segment to segment. In a few exceptional
cases (<i>Ligula</i>) the sexual organs are already developed in
the larval stage, but are only functional after the entry of the parasite
into the final host.</p>

<p>With the exception of the end portions of the vagina, cirrus and

(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_185">185</a>, <i>T.</i>); a vas efferens arises from each testis, unites with<span class="pagenum" title="294"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a></span>
contiguous vasa, and finally discharges into the muscular vas deferens

convoluted or twisted, and frequently possesses a dilatation termed

<p>The vagina, like the vas deferens, usually runs inwardly and
posteriorly, where it forms a spindle-shaped dilatation (receptaculum
seminis); its continuation, the spermatic duct, unites with the
oviduct, the common duct of the ovaries (fig.&nbsp;191). The ovaries,
usually two in number, are compound tubular glands in the posterior
half of the proglottis, which extend into the medullary layer, but
ventral to the median plane.</p>

<p>At the origin of the oviduct there is frequently a dilatation provided
with circular muscles (suction apparatus), which receives the
ovarian cells and propels them forward. After the oviduct has
received the spermatic duct the canal proceeds as the fertilization
canal, and after a very short course receives the vitelline duct or
ducts, and then the numerous ducts of the shell glands (oÃ¶type).
[Although the nomenclature of these parts varies, we may consider
the oviduct as extending from the ovary to the shell gland and
as receiving the spermatic duct and then the vitelline duct and the
ducts of the shell gland. The short piece into which the shell gland
ducts open corresponds to the oÃ¶type in the flukes, but in the tapeworms
this portion of the canal is seldom dilated. From this point<span class="pagenum" title="296"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a></span>
the oviduct is continued as a shorter or longer tube, the uterine canal
or true oviduct opening into the uterus proper.&mdash;J.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;S.]
The vitellarium may be single, but often exhibits its primitive
duplication more or less distinctly, in which case it is situated at the
posterior border of the segments in the medullary layer (fig.&nbsp;191).
The original position of the double organ is, moreover, the same
as in the Trematodes, <i>i.e.</i>, at the sides of the proglottids, and thence
eventually extending more or less on both surfaces (figs.&nbsp;192 and 194);
the gland is then distinctly grape-like and the follicles lie mostly in
the cortical layer.</p>

<p>The egg cell that has been fertilized and supplied with yolk cells
receives the shell material at the point of entry of the shell gland ducts,
and, as a complete egg, then moves onward to the uterus. In those
cases in which the uterus in its further course presents a convoluted
canal, and may form a rosette (pseudo-phyllidea), there is an external
opening which is usually separate from the genital pore, and lies on
the same or the opposite surface. In all other cases, however, the
uterus terminates blindly and is represented by a longer or shorter sac
lying in the longitudinal axis (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_191">191</a>), but in many forms transversely.
With the accumulation of eggs it becomes modified in
various ways: (1) it sends out lateral branches (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_241">241</a>), or (2) forms
numerous isolated sacs (<span class="lowercase smcap">PARENCHYMAL CAPSULES</span>) containing single
eggs or groups of eggs (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_217">217</a>); further, (3) in some cases at the
blind end one or more special thick-walled cavities are formed
(<span class="lowercase smcap">PARUTERINE ORGANS</span> or <span class="lowercase smcap">UTERINE CAPSULES</span>), in which all or most of
the eggs are collected, the uterus then undergoing atrophy.</p>

<p>In species in which the uterus lacks an opening, simultaneously
with the growth of this organ an atrophy of the male apparatus, at
least of the testes and their excretory ducts, takes place; this atrophy
also frequently occurs in the female glands, so that the entire mature
segments have besides the uterus only traces of the genitalia left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="297"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>AcoleÃ¯nÃ¦</i> the vagina is more or less extensively atrophied,
and in any case has no external opening.</p>

<p>A number of genera are distinguished by the duplication of
the genitalia in every segment; the genital apparatus in its entirety,
or with the exception of the uterus, is double, or the genital glands
and the uterus are single, but the cirrus, vas deferens and vagina
are double.</p>

<p>On comparing the genitalia of the Trematodes and Cestodes the
parts will be found to agree, but the vagina of the Cestodes
corresponds with the uterus of the Trematodes, and the uterus of the
tapeworms to Laurerâs canal of the Trematodes, which in most of the
Cestodes has lost its external orifice.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Development of the Tapeworms.</span></h5>

<p><i>Copulation.</i>&mdash;As each proglottis possesses its own genital apparatus,
and male as well as female organs are present, the following processes
may occur: (1) self- or auto-fecundation (without immissio cirri);
(2) self- or auto-copulation (with immissio cirri); (3) cross-copulation
between proglottids of the same or different chains (of the same
species); and (4) cross-copulation in the same proglottis in species
with double genital pores. These various modes have actually been
observed.</p>

<p>In those species which lack the vagina (<i>AcoleÃ¯nÃ¦</i>) it appears that
the cirri, which are always furnished with hooks, are driven into
the tissues and for the most part reach the receptaculum seminis.</p>

<p>The <i>eggs</i> of all Cestodes are provided with shells, but the shells,
like their contents, vary. In genera that possess a uterine pore the
mature eggs frequently do not differ from those of the Distomata;
they have a brown or yellow shell of oval form provided with an
operculum, and contain a number of yolk cells in addition to the
fertilized ovarian cell (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_128">128</a>), but in other genera (with a uterine
pore) the lid is absent and the egg-shell is very thin, the eggs of these
genera resembling those of Cestodes in which the secretion of the
vitellarium is a light albumin-like substance that contains only a
few granules, and in which the egg-shell is very delicate and without
operculum.</p>

<p>The eggs of <i>TÃ¦niidÃ¦</i>, for example, at first consist of egg-shell
(oÃ¶type), ovum and yolk cells. The egg-shell is as a rule soft, colourless
and frequently deciduous, and the yolk is scanty in amount and
contains few granules. The eggs are, moreover, more complicated
than this. They enlarge and change their shape and various envelopes
are developed around the embryo. The egg-shell proper often disappears,
and one or more embryonal envelopes, or protoplasmic<span class="pagenum" title="298"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a></span>
layers, arise, so that eventually it is difficult to say whether the whole
egg is present, and, if not, what the layers that remain really are.</p>

<p>The <i>embryonal development</i> in most species takes place during the
stay of the eggs in the uterus; in other species it takes place after the
eggs have been deposited and are in water. Separate cells or a layer of
cells always separate from the segmentation cells, as well as from the
cells of the developing embryo, and form one or more envelopes round
the embryo; usually two such envelopes are formed, the inner one
of which stands in intimate relationship with the embryo itself and
is often erroneously termed the egg-shell, but more correctly the
embryonal shell or <i>embryophore</i>. In some species it carries long cilia,
as in <i>Dibothriocephalus latus</i>, by aid of which the young swim about
when released from the egg-shell; as a general rule, however, there
are no cilia and this envelope is homogeneous, or is composed of
numerous rods and is calcified, as in <i>TÃ¦nia</i> spp. (fig.&nbsp;197). The
second outer envelope (âyolk envelopeâ) (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_207">207</a>, 3) lies close within
the true (oÃ¶type) egg-shell, and remains within it when the embryo
hatches out, and in many species, as in <i>TÃ¦nia</i> spp., it perishes at the
end of the embryonal development with the delicate egg-shell which
was formed in the oÃ¶type, so that one observes not the entire egg
with egg-shell but only the embryo in its embryonal shell, <i>viz.</i>, the
embryophore (fig.&nbsp;197, <i>a.</i>).</p>

<i>Dipylidium caninum</i>. (After Grassi

</div>

<p>The embryo (the <span class="lowercase smcap">ONCOSPHERE</span>) enclosed within the embryonal
shell (embryophore) is of spheroidal or ovoid form (fig.&nbsp;197, <i>b.</i>), and is
distinguished by the possession of three pairs of spines, a few terminal
(flame) cells of the excretory system, and muscles to move the spines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No further development</span> of the oncosphere takes place, either
in the parent organism or in the open; in fact, in all cases in which
the oncospheres are already formed within the proglottids they do
not become free, but remain in their shell; it is only when the
oncospheres are provided with a ciliated embryophore that they leave
the egg-shell, and they even cast this ciliated envelope after having<span class="pagenum" title="299"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a></span>
swum about in water by its means for a week or so. Sooner or later,
however, all the oncospheres leave the host that harbours the parental
tapeworm and reach the open, either still enclosed in the uterus of
the evacuated proglottids, after the disintegration of which they
then become free, or after being deposited as eggs in the intestine
of the host; they then leave it with the fÃ¦ces. In the former case
also, the slightest injury to the mature proglottids while still in the
intestine suffices to allow a part of the oncospheres in their embryophores
to be released and mingled with the fÃ¦ces. Here they are the
generally, but falsely, so-called TÃ¦niÃ¦ âeggs.â For, as stated above,
the âyolkâ envelope and the true shell deposited in the oÃ¶type have
before this disintegrated.</p>

<p>In other cases, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Hymenolepis</i> spp., the uterine (oÃ¶type) shell
persists in fÃ¦ces (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_230">230</a>).</p>

<p>In any case the oncospheres
must be transmitted into suitable
animals to effect their further development;
in only very rare cases
might an active invasion be possible,
as, for instance, takes place with the
miracidia of many Trematodes. The
entry into an animal is, as a rule,
entirely passive, that is to say, the
oncospheres are swallowed with the
food or water. Many animals are
coprophagous and ingest the oncospheres
direct with the fÃ¦ces; others
swallow them with water, mud, or
food contaminated by such fÃ¦ces. Infection is easily produced
artificially by feeding suitable animals with mature proglottids of
certain Cestodes or introducing the oncospheres with the food. As
the mature tapeworm frequently finds the conditions suitable for its
development in only one species of host, or in species nearly related,
and perishes when artificially introduced into other hosts, experiment
has taught us that to succeed in cultivating the oncospheres certain
species of animals are necessary. Thus we are aware that the oncospheres
of <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i>, which lives in the intestine of man, develop
only in the pig, and only quite exceptionally develop into the stage
characteristic of all Cestodes&mdash;the cysticercus in the wide sense of the
word&mdash;in a few other mammals. The oncospheres of <i>T. saginata</i>
develop further only in the ox; those of <i>T. marginata</i> (of the dog) in
the pig, goat, and sheep; those of <i>T. serrata</i> (of the dog) in hares and
rabbits; those of <i>Dipylidium caninum</i> (of the dog and cat) in parasitic
insects of the dog and cat, etc. It is not unusual that young animals<span class="pagenum" title="300"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a></span>
only appear to be capable of infection, while older animals of the
same species are not so.</p>

<p>Once introduced into a suitable animal, which is only exceptionally
the same individual or belongs to the same species as the
one which harbours the adult tapeworm, the oncosphere passes
into the larval stage common to all Cestodes, but varying in structure
according to the species. In the simplest case&mdash;as, <i>e.g.</i>, in <i>Dibothriocephalus</i>&mdash;such
a larva resembles the scolex of the corresponding
tapeworm, only that the head, provided with suckers, is retracted
within the fore-part of the neck. Such a larval form is known as a
<i>plerocercoid</i> (ÏÎ»á½µÎµÏÎ·Ï, full; Îºá½³ÏÎºÎ¿Ï, tail). They differ from the cysticercoids
in being solid larval forms, elongated, tape-like or oval, with the
head invaginated. The conditions appear to be similar in <i>Ligula</i>,
<i>Schistocephalus</i>, <i>TriÃ¦nophorus</i>, but here the larvÃ¦ are very large, indeed
as large in the first-mentioned genera as the tapeworms originating
from them, and the sexual organs are already outlined; doubtless,
however, this stage is preceded by one that corresponds to the scolex
of the genus in question, and which represents the actual larval stage.
In such cases the development of the body of the tapeworm from the
scolex has already begun within the first or intermediate host; in
other cases, except in the single-jointed (monozootic) Cestodes, this
only takes place in the definitive host. The direct metamorphosis
of the oncosphere into the larval forms termed <span class="lowercase smcap">PLEROCERCOID</span> has
hitherto not been investigated, although <i>Ligula</i>, <i>Schistocephalus</i> and
<i>Bothriocephalus</i> are very common parasites, but many circumstances
point to the conclusions arrived at by us and by other observers. In
the larval stages of other tapeworms we can always distinguish the
scolex and a caudal-like appendage, vesicular in the cysticerci (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_200">200</a>),
compact in the cysticercoids (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_231">231</a>). The scolex alone forms the
future tapeworm, the variously formed appendage perishing.</p>

<p>It has now been proved that the appendage, the caudal vesicle,
originates direct from the body of the oncosphere, and therefore is
primary, and that the scolex only subsequently forms through proliferation
on the surface of this appendage. On account of this
origin the scolex is generally regarded as the daughter, and the part
usually designated as the appendage as the mother, originating from
the oncosphere.</p>

<p>Accordingly, two modes of development of the larval stage may
be distinguished; in the one case, plerocerci and plerocercoids, the
oncosphere changes directly into the scolex, thus forming the body
of the tapeworm within the primary host; in the other case, cysticerci
and cysticercoids, the scolex only forms secondarily in the transformed
body of the oncosphere, which later on perishes, the scolex
alone remaining as the originator of the tapeworm colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="301"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a></span></p>

<p>We may summarize briefly what has been said regarding these
larval forms. We have, firstly, solid larval forms without any bladder.
These arise <i>directly</i> from the oncosphere and are of two kinds,
plerocercus and plerocercoid. <i>Plerocercus</i> is a solid <i>globular</i> larva with
the head invaginated into the posterior portion. <i>Plerocercoid</i> (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_208">208</a>)
is a solid <i>elongated</i> larva also with the head invaginated into the
posterior portion, which is sometimes very long. Secondly, we
have larval forms with bladders from which the scolices arise thus
<i>indirectly</i> from the oncosphere. They are of two kinds, cysticercoid
and cysticercus.</p>

<p><i>Cysticercoid.</i>&mdash;The bladder is but slightly developed and is usually
absorbed again. The anterior portion is, moreover, retracted into
the posterior, and in some cases there is a long or a stumpy tail
(figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_220">220</a>, <a href="#Fig_231">231</a>).</p>

<p><i>Cysticercus</i>, or true bladder worms. (These may be divided into
(1) cysticercus proper, consisting of a bladder and one scolex;
(2) cÅnurus, a bladder and many scolices; (3) echinococcus, a
bladder in which daughter bladders or cysts are developed, and then
in these multiple scolices.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In the case of cysticerci a papilliform invagination forms, projecting
into the interior of the bladder (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_201">201</a>). The layer of cells
forming the papilla becomes divided into two laminÃ¦, the outer<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> of
which forms a kind of investing membrane (receptaculum capitis) for
the papilla. The head and suckers are now developed on the walls
bounding the axial lumen of the papilla. The papilla eventually<span class="pagenum" title="302"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a></span>
evaginates, so that the receptaculum capitis now forms the inner
surface of the hollow head, which eventually becomes solid.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the development of cysticerci in the wide
sense of the word is limited almost exclusively to that of a few true
âbladder wormsâ (cysticerci); in other cases we know either only
the terminal stage, <i>i.e.</i>, the complete larva, or, exceptionally, one of
the intermediate stages, but we are not acquainted with a complete
series; the description must therefore be incomplete.</p>

<p>We know from feeding experiments that, after the introduction
of mature proglottids or of the fully developed ova of <i>TÃ¦nia
crassicollis</i> (of the cat) into the stomach of mice, the oncospheres
escape from the shell in the middle portion of the small intestine,
and a few hours later penetrate into the intestinal wall by means
of a boring movement; they have been found in this position twenty-seven
to thirty hours after the infection. By means of this migration,
for which purpose they employ their spines, they attain the blood-vessels
of the intestine; indeed, already nine hours after the infection
and later they are found in the blood of the portal vein, and in the
course of the second day after infection they are found in the
capillaries of the liver, which these larvÃ¦ do not leave.</p>

<p>Leuckart, in experimental feeding of rabbits with oncospheres
of <i>TÃ¦nia serrata</i> (of the dog), found free oncospheres in the stomach
of the experimental animal, but not in the intestine: however,
he came across them again in the blood of the portal vein. The
passage through the blood-vessels to the liver is the normal one
for those species of <i>TÃ¦nia</i> the eggs of which become larvae in
mammals; even in those cases in which the oncospheres develop
further in the omentum or in the abdominal cavity (<i>Cysticercus
tenuicollis</i>, <i>C. pisiformis</i>), there are distinct changes observable in
the liver that lead one to the conclusion that there has been a
secondary migration out of the liver into the abdominal cavity.
Indeed, one must not imagine that the young stages of the Cestodes
are absolutely passive; once they have invaded an organ they travel
actively, and leave distinct traces of their passage.</p>

<p>In other cases the oncospheres leave the liver with the circulation,
and are thus distributed further in the body; they may settle and
develop in one or more organs or tissues. Many oncospheres may,
by travelling through the intestinal wall, penetrate through it and
attain the abdominal cavity direct; some, perhaps, pass also into the
lymph stream. Where there are no blood and lymphatic vessels in
the intestinal wall, as in insects, the oncospheres attain the body
cavity or its organs direct; in short, they never remain in the
intestinal lumen itself, and only rarely&mdash;as in <i>Hymenolepis murina</i>
of the rat&mdash;do they remain in the intestinal wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="303"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the infection has been intense, and the body is crowded with numerous
oncospheres, acute feverish symptoms, are induced, to which the infected animals
usually succumb (âacute cestode tuberculosisâ); while in other cases the alterations
in the organs attacked&mdash;as the liver in mice and the brain in sheep&mdash;may cause death.</p></div>

<p>Sooner or later the oncospheres of tapeworms come to rest,
and are first transformed into a bladder, which may be round or
oval according to the species. The embryonal spines disappear sooner
or later, or remain close together or spread over some part of the
bladder wall (fig.&nbsp;200). Their discovery by V. Stein in the bladder
worm of the âmeal wormâ (the larva of a beetle, <i>Tenebrio molitor</i>)
first led to the conclusion that bladder worms (cysticerci) actually
originate from the oncospheres of <i>TÃ¦niidÃ¦</i>.</p>

head; 6, complete evagination effected by pressure. (Stephens.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The bladder may remain as a bladder, and then by proliferation
the scolex forms on its wall (fig.&nbsp;202), or it may divide into an
anterior so-called âcysticâ portion and a solid tail-like appendage of
various lengths, on which the embryonal hooks are to be found,
and this is particularly the case in those larval forms (cysticercoids),
<i>e.g.</i>, those of <i>Dipylidium caninum</i>, that develop in invertebrate animals,
such as Arthropoda.</p>

<p>As mentioned above one may regard the scolex as an individual
that originates through proliferation of the wall of the parent cyst,
mostly singly, but in those cysticerci that are termed cÅnurus
(fig.&nbsp;201) many scolices occur, whereas in those called echinococcus
the parent cyst originating from the oncosphere of <i>TÃ¦nia echinococcus</i>
(of the dog) first produces a number of daughter cysts, which in their<span class="pagenum" title="304"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a></span>
turn form numerous scolices. Echinococcus-like conditions also
occur in cysticercoids, as, for instance, in those peculiar to earthworms;
and similar conditions prevail in a larval form known as
<i>Staphylocystis</i>, found in the wood-louse (<i>Glomeris</i>). Thus it happens in
these cases that finally <i>one</i> tapeworm egg produces not <i>one</i>, but
numerous tapeworms, for, under
favourable conditions, each scolex
can form a tapeworm.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The rudiment of the scolex appears as a hollow bud, the cephalic invagination
usually directed towards the interior of the bladder cavity; on its invaginated
surface arise the four suckers, and the rostellum with the
hook apparatus is formed in its blind end; we thus get a
TÃ¦nia head, but with the position of the parts reversed
(fig.&nbsp;201). In many cysticerci the head rises up from the
base of the cephalic invagination and is then surrounded by
the latter. A more or less elongated piece of neck also
develops, and even proglottids may appear, as in <i>Cysticercus
fasciolaris</i> (the larva of <i>TÃ¦nia crassicollis</i> of the cat) of the
MuridÃ¦, a process somewhat analogous to that of Ligula, etc.</p></div>

<p>The period that elapses from the time of
infection till the cysticercus is fully developed
varies according to the species; the cysticercus
of <i>TÃ¦nia saginata</i> requires twenty-eight weeks,
that of <i>T. marginata</i> seven to eight weeks, that
of <i>T. solium</i> three to four months, and that of
<i>T. echinococcus</i> longer still.</p>

</div>

<p>With one single exception (<i>Archigetes</i>) the
larvÃ¦ do not become sexually mature in the organ
where they have developed; they must enter the
terminal host, a matter that is usually purely
passive, the carriers of the larvÃ¦ or infected parts
of them being usually devoured by other animals. In this manner, for
instance, the larvÃ¦ (<i>Cysticercus fasciolaris</i>) found in mice and rats reach<span class="pagenum" title="305"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a></span>
the intestine of cats; those of the hare and rabbit (<i>C. pisiformis</i>) reach
the intestine of dogs; those of the pig (<i>C. cellulosÃ¦</i>) are introduced into
man; those of insects are swallowed by insectivorous birds; those of
crustaceans are ingested by ducks and other water fowl; perhaps,
also, the infection of herbivorous mammals is caused by their
accidentally swallowing smaller creatures infected by larvÃ¦. Indeed,
the researches of Grassi and Rovelli have taught us that such an
intermediate host is not always necessary; <i>Hymenolepis murina</i> of
rats and mice in its larval stage lives in the intestinal wall of these
rodents, and as a larva it passes into the intestinal lumen and develops
into a tapeworm in exactly the same way as the larvÃ¦ of other species
that reach the intestine of the terminal host by means of an intermediate
carrier. Probably this curtailed manner of transmission also
occurs in many other species. In some cases the larvÃ¦ actively quit
the body of the intermediate host, as in the case of <i>Ligula</i> and <i>Schistocephalus</i>,
which travel out of the body cavity of infected fish and
reach the water, where they may be observed in hundreds in summer,
at all events in some localities. The larval stage of <i>Calliobothrium</i>&mdash;wrongly
termed <i>Scolex</i>&mdash;has been observed swimming free in the sea,
and the scolices of <i>Rhynchobothrium</i>, without their mother cysts, have
been observed free within the tissues of several marine animals. In
any case there is almost always a change of hosts, even in the single-jointed
Cestodes, for the larva of <i>CaryophyllÃ¦us</i>, which lives in fishes
of the carp family, is found in limicoline OligochÃ¦tes, that of <i>Gyrocotyle</i>
(ChimÃ¦ra) in shell-fish (Mactra), and different conditions can
hardly be possible for <i>Amphilina</i>. <i>Archigetes</i> alone becomes sexually
mature in the larval stage, but the life-history of this creature is not
well known, so that it is not impossible that the attainment of sexual
maturity as a larva in invertebrates (OligochÃ¦tes) is perhaps abnormal,
and somewhat analogous to the maturity of some encysted
Trematodes.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">METAMORPHOSIS OF THE LARVA</span> into the tapeworm is rarely
accomplished in a simple manner; the transformation, however, is
not complex in the single-jointed Cestodes, nor in <i>Ligula</i> and <i>Schistocephalus</i>;
the latter is swallowed by birds (<i>Mergus</i>, <i>Anas</i>, etc.), produces
eggs after only a few days, and very soon quits the intestine of its
terminal host. In all other cases it is the scolex only which, by
proliferating at its posterior extremity, forms the proglottids, after
having invaded as a larva the intestine of a suitable host. The mother
cysts, or what corresponds to them, die, are digested, absorbed, or
perhaps even eliminated; on the contrary, segments found on the
scolex during the larval stage, also in the case of <i>Cysticercus fasciolaris</i>,
are retained. It is not certain whether the larvÃ¦ of <i>Dibothriocephalus</i>
lose any part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="306"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a></span></p>

<p>The time required by the scolex to complete the entire chain
of proglottids does not depend only on the number it has to
produce, for <i>TÃ¦nia echinococcus</i>, which, as a rule, only possesses
three or four segments, takes quite as long a time for their growth
(eleven to twelve weeks) as <i>T. solium</i> with its numerous segments;
<i>T. cÅnurus</i> is fully developed in three to four weeks, and
the same holds good for <i>Dibothriocephalus latus</i>, which possesses
many more segments than the above-mentioned TÃ¦nia of the dog.
In a number of species it has been possible to determine fairly
accurately the average daily growth; for instance, in <i>Dibothriocephalus
latus</i> the daily growth is 8&nbsp;cm., in <i>TÃ¦nia saginata</i> 7&nbsp;cm., etc.</p>

<p>The history of the development of the Cestodes demonstrates that
persons and beasts harbouring larval tapeworms have become
infected by having swallowed the oncospheres of the species of
tapeworm to which they belong. In regard to <i>Hymenolepis murina</i>
alone, it is known that the introduction of the oncospheres into those
species of animals which harbour the adult tapeworm leads to the
formation of the latter after the development of a larval stage in the
intestinal wall; nevertheless, only young animals (rats) are capable of
infection, for a previous infection, or the presence of mature tapeworms
in the intestine, appears to produce a kind of immunity.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Biology.</span></h5>

<p>In their adult stage, the tapeworms inhabit almost exclusively
the alimentary canal of vertebrate animals, with but few exceptions
the small intestine, and a few species select definite parts of it. A
small number of <i>RhynchobothriidÃ¦</i> of marine fishes live apparently
always in the stomach, while in rays and sharks the spiral intestine is
their exclusive site. Bothriocephali generally attach themselves with
their head on to the appendices of the pylorus of fishes; other
species (<i>Hymenolepis diminuta</i>) occasionally fix their head in the
ductus choledochus, and this is more frequent still in the tapeworms
of the rock badger (<i>Hyrax</i>), which occasionally penetrate entirely
into the biliary ducts. <i>Stilesia hepatica</i>, Wolffh., has so far only been
found in the bile-ducts of its host (sheep and goat, East Africa).</p>

<p>In the disease of sheep induced by Cestodes, the worms have
been observed also in the pancreas. Specimens found in the large
intestines were probably being evacuated.</p>

<p>The Cestodes are looked upon as fairly inert creatures, this
opinion having been formed by observing their condition in the cold
cadavers of warm-blooded animals. Actually, however, they are
exceedingly active, and accomplish local movements within the
intestine, for they have been found in the ducts communicating with<span class="pagenum" title="307"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a></span>
the bowel, or in the stomach, and may even make their way forward
into the Åsophagus.</p>

<p>They also invade other abdominal organs through abnormal communications,
or through any that may be temporarily open between
the intestine and such organs; they thus reach the abdominal cavity or
the urinary bladder, or they work their way through the peritoneum.</p>

<p>They produce changes in the intestinal mucous membrane at the
place of their attachment, the alterations varying in intensity according
to the structure of the fixation organs. The mucous membrane
is elevated in knob-like areas by the suckers; the epithelial cells
become atrophied or may be entirely obliterated. <i>Dipylidium
caninum</i> bores into the openings of LieberkÃ¼hnâs glands with its
rostellum, dilating the lumen to two or three times its normal size,
while the suckers remain fixed between the basal parts of the cells.
Species with powerful armatures penetrate deeper into the submucosa,
and some that are not provided with exceptionally strong armatures,
or are even unarmed, may be actually found with the scolex embedded
in the muscles of the intestinal walls or even protruding beyond
(<i>TÃ¦nia tetragona</i>, Mol., in fowls, etc.). Other species, again, even
cause perforation of the walls of the intestine of their hosts.</p>

<p>It is generally assumed that tapeworms, which almost without
exception live in the gut of vertebrates, get their nutriment from the
gut contents, which apparently they absorb through the whole body
surface (cuticular trophopores). In favour of this view is the
existence of fat drops in the proglottids, the identity in colour in
certain forms between that of the fresh worm and the gut contents
and the passage of certain substances derived from medicines (iron
and mercury preparation) into the worms in the gut, etc. Whether
the suckers are concerned in the absorption of nutriment and to
what extent is still questionable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The length of life of the adult tapeworm</span> certainly varies;
as a rule it appears to last only about a year; in other cases (<i>Ligula</i>)
it averages only a few days, but we are likewise aware that certain
species of Cestodes of man attain an age of several or many years
(thirty-five). The natural death of Cestodes often appears to be
brought about by alterations in the scolex, such as loss of the hooks,
atrophy of the suckers and rostellum, finally the dropping off of the
scolex; it is unknown whether a chain of segments deprived of its
scolex then perishes or whether it first attains maturity. It has already
been mentioned that in a few species the foremost proglottids are
transformed into organs of fixation on the normal loss of the scolex.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Abnormalities and malformations are encountered relatively frequently in the
Cestodes&mdash;such as abnormally short or long segments; the so-called triangular
tapeworms, which&mdash;if belonging to the <i>TÃ¦niidÃ¦</i>&mdash;always possess six suckers; often<span class="pagenum" title="308"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a></span>
also club-shaped segments occur between normal ones, or there may be a defect
in one segment or in the centre of a number following one another (fenestrated
segments); bifurcated chains of segments have likewise been observed, as well as
incomplete or complete union of the proglottids, abnormal increase of the genital
pores, reversion of the genitalia. Besides the above-mentioned increase of the
number of suckers on the scolex (in TÃ¦niÃ¦), there may be a decrease in the
number; in other cases the crown of hooks may be absent, or abnormally shaped
hooks may be formed.</p></div>

<p>Length 2 to 9&nbsp;m. or more; colour yellowish-grey; after lying in
water the lateral areas become brownish and the uterine rosette
brown. The head is almond-shaped, 2 to 3&nbsp;mm. in length, the dorso-ventral
axis is longer than the transverse diameter; the head, therefore,
generally lying flat, conceals the suctorial grooves at the borders;
these suckers are deep and have sharp edges (fig.&nbsp;205). The neck
varies in length according to the degree of contraction and is very
thin; there are 3,000 to 4,200 proglottids and there may be more;
their breadth is usually greater than their length, but in the posterior
third of the body they are almost square, and the very oldest are not
uncommonly longer than they are broad. There are numerous testes
situated dorsally in the medullary layer of the lateral fields; the vas
deferens (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_192">192</a>) passes dorsally in transverse loops in the central
field anteriorly and forms a seminal vesicle before its entry into the
large cirrus pouch.</p>

<p>The orifice of the vagina is close behind the orifice of the cirrus;
the former passes almost straight along the median line posteriorly,
and widens into a receptaculum seminis shortly before its junction
with the oviduct; the ovary is bilobed, in shape like the wings
of a butterfly, ventrally in the medullary layer; the shell glands lie
in the posterior recess of the ovary; the uterus, forming numerous
transverse convolutions, passes ventral to the vas deferens forwards.
Eggs (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_207">207</a>) large, with brownish shells and small lids, 68&nbsp;Âµ to 71&nbsp;Âµ
by 45&nbsp;Âµ; the ovarian cell, which is already, as a rule, in process of
segmentation, is surrounded by numerous large yolk cells; the

with the fÃ¦ces, hatch in water after a fortnight or more; the embryonal
integument (embryophore) of the oncosphere is provided with cilia;
after bursting open the lid of the egg the oncosphere in its embryophore
(fig.&nbsp;207) reaches the water and swims slowly about; often it
slips out of its ciliated embryophore, sinks to the bottom and is capable
of a creeping motion; sooner or later it dies in the water. The
manner and means of its invasion of an intermediate host are still
unknown; yet we are aware that the larval stage (plerocercoid,
fig.&nbsp;208), which resembles the scolex and may reach a length of 30&nbsp;mm.,
lives in the intestine, in the intestinal wall, in the liver, spleen, genital
glands and muscular system (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_209">209</a>) of various fresh-water fish,
the pike (<i>Esox lucius</i>), the millerâs thumb (<i>Lota vulgaris</i>), the perch
(<i>Perea fluviatilis</i>), <i>Salmo umbla</i>, <i>Trutta vulgaris</i>, <i>Tr. lacustris</i>, <i>Thymallis
vulgaris</i> (grayling), <i>Coregonus lavaretus</i>, <i>C. albula</i> (in Europe) and
<i>Onchorhynchus perryi</i> (in Japan). The transmission of the plerocercoids
from these fish to the dog, cat and man (Braun, Parona, Grassi

the development of the broad tapeworm, the growth of which is rapid.
In my experiments on human beings the average number of proglottids
formed per diem averaged thirty-one to thirty-two for five
weeks, with a length of 8 to 9&nbsp;cm. According to Parona the eggs
appear twenty-four days after man has been infected. Zschokke found
the average growth in the experimental infection of man between 5Â·2
and 8Â·2&nbsp;cm. per diem, and the person experimented upon by Ijima

<p>The âbroad tapewormâ is a frequent parasite
of man in some districts, but it also occurs in the
domestic dog, and on rare occasions is found in
the domestic cat (together with <i>Dibothriocephalus
felis</i>, Crepl.) and fox. French Switzerland and the
Baltic Provinces of Russia are the centres of distribution;
from the former districts the distribution
radiates to France and Italy (Lombardy, Piedmont);
from the Baltic Provinces over Ingermanland
to Petrograd, over Finland to Sweden (on the
shore of the Gulf of Bothnia), in a southerly direction
to Poland, and into the Russian Empire and
across it to Roumania, and towards the west along
the coast of the Baltic Sea to the North Sea, where, however, its
frequency considerably diminishes (Holland, Belgium, and the
North of France).</p>

<p>In Turkestan and Japan the âbroad tapewormâ is the most
frequent parasite of man; it has been reported in Africa from the
vicinity of Lake Nâgami as well as from Madagascar; cases, in
part at least imported, have also come under observation in North
America.</p>

<p>In Germany <i>Dibothriocephalus latus</i>&mdash;apart from the fact that
it is undoubtedly imported from Switzerland, Russia or Italy&mdash;is<span class="pagenum" title="314"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a></span>
particularly frequent in East Prussia amongst the inhabitants of
the Courland Lagoon district, on the Baltic; it is, moreover, also
found in the Province and even in the City of KÃ¶nigsberg. In West
Prussia and Pomerania it is very much scarcer.</p>

<p>It is also found in Munich and in the vicinity of the Lake of
Starnberg (Bollinger).</p>

<p>Krabbe found it in 10 per cent. of the sufferers from tapeworms
in Denmark; Szydlowski found the ova of this worm in
Dorpat in 10 per cent. of the fÃ¦ces examined; Kruse found the
worm in 6 per cent. of <i>post-mortems</i>; Kessler, in Petrograd,
found the eggs in the fÃ¦ces in 7Â·8 per cent.; at <i>post-mortems</i> he
found the worms in 1Â·17 per cent., though Winogradoff only found
it in 0Â·8 per cent. In Moscow, according to Baranovsky, 8Â·9
per cent. of the fÃ¦ces examined contained the ova of <i>Dibothriocephalus</i>.
In the interior and southern provinces of Sweden the
worm, according to LÃ¶nnberg, is only found sporadically, but, on
the other hand, in Angermanland about 10 per cent. of the population
is affected; while again in Norbotten the majority of persons
are affected, and in Haparanda the entire population (with the
exception of infants) harbour this parasite. In Switzerland
<i>D. latus</i> is very frequent in close proximity to the lakes of Bieler,
Neuchatel, Morat and Geneva (according to Zaeslin 10 to 15 to
20 per cent. of the population are affected); the parasite is less
frequent in districts one to four hours removed from these lakes.</p>

<p>Of the fish from Swiss lakes examined by Schor those from
Lake Geneva were most commonly infected, and especially <i>Lota</i> sp.
and <i>Perea</i> sp.</p>

<p>The frequency and distribution have, nevertheless, decreased
perceptibly in places; at the commencement of the eighteenth
century the broad tapeworm was very common in Paris, at the
present date it only occurs when imported (Blanchard); in
Geneva, also, according to Zschokke, it has become rarer (formerly
10 per cent., now only 1 per cent.).</p>

<p>The disturbances produced in man by the presence of broad
tapeworms are, as a rule, very trifling; in other cases they produce
partly gastric disorders and partly nervous symptoms; in a number
of cases, again, they set up severe anÃ¦mia, apparently caused by
toxins produced by the worms and absorbed by the host. There
is no danger of auto-infection, as the larval stage lives only in
fishes, not in warm-blooded animals. The case reported by
Meschede (ova like those of <i>Dibothriocephalus latus</i> in the brain of
a man who had suffered from epilepsy for six years) must be otherwise
explained.</p>

</div>

<p>Human beings, like other hosts, can only acquire the broad<span class="pagenum" title="315"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a></span>
tapeworm by ingesting its plerocercoids with the previously mentioned
fresh-water fishes; the opportunity for such infection is
afforded the more readily by the fact that not only do the lower
classes not pay sufficient attention to the cooking of fish, so that
all the larvÃ¦ that are present may be killed, but also in certain
localities the custom exists of eating some parts of these fishes in a
raw condition; even the mere handling of the usually severely
infected intermediary hosts may occasionally cause infection. The
plerocercoids are as well known as, but differ materially in appearance
from, the cysticerci (<i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i>) of pigâs flesh. In
Germany the occurrence of the plerocercoids of <i>Dibothriocephalus
latus</i> has been confirmed in the pike, millerâs thumb and perch of
East Prussia, and more particularly in those taken from the Courland
Lagoon.</p>

<p>The life of <i>D. latus</i> is a very long one (six to fourteen years),
as is deduced from persons who have left <i>D. latus</i> regions after they
have been infected.</p>

<p>According to the experiments of M. Schor, plerocercoids of
<i>D. latus</i> placed in slowly warmed water completely lose their movement
at 54Â° to 55Â°&nbsp;C.; they survive the death of their host for several
days; they are killed by low temperatures -3Â° to +1Â°&nbsp;C. in two
days; strong acids and salt solutions kill them at once, also high
temperatures, but all the same at least ten minutes is required in
boiling or frying fish in order to kill the plerocercoids with
certainty.</p>

<p>These plerocercoids were discovered in 1882 by P. Manson

and one free in the abdominal cavity.
Cobbold described them as <i>Ligula mansoni</i>, and
Leuckart, who contemporaneously reported a case
in Japan, termed them <i>Bothriocephalus liguloides</i>.
Ijima and Murata reported eight further cases, and
Miyake records nine further cases, seven of which
are recorded in Japanese literature.</p>

<p>The plerocercoid, which hitherto alone is known
to us, attains a length of 30&nbsp;cm. and a breadth of
3 to 6 to 12&nbsp;mm. The ribbon-shaped body is
wrinkled, the lateral borders are often somewhat
thickened, so that the transverse section has the
form of a biscuit; the anterior end is usually wider
and has the head provided with two weak suctorial
grooves, either retracted or protracted.</p>

<p>The parasite makes migrations within the body,
and thus may reach the urinary passages; then it is
either evacuated with the urine or has to be removed
from the urethra; not rarely it causes non-inflammatory
tumours on various parts of the skin, which
are at times painful and at times vary in size.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of its development and origin.</p>

<p>These plerocercoids produce an acne-like condition
of the skin. The condition is really one of
capsules in great abundance in the subcutaneous
tissue and less so in the corium and in the intermuscular
connective tissue. The encapsuled worms
in the corium feel like embedded rice grains and
raise the epidermis, giving rise to an acne-like condition.
Many thousands occur scattered over the
body; in Ijimaâs Japanese case there were over
10,000 in the left thigh. The worms when they first
appear in the skin cause itching. The capsules are
ovoid, generally about 1 to 2&nbsp;mm. in diameter, but
they may be smaller and also much larger. The
larger ones occur in the subcutaneous tissue. The
capsules consist of dense tough connective tissue.</p>

<p>Each capsule, as a rule, contains one worm, but as many as seven
may occur. The skin of areas that have been long infected is swollen<span class="pagenum" title="319"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a></span>
and indurated or adherent, giving a somewhat elephantoid appearance.
The subcutaneous tissue is thick and filled with slimy fluid or in
other parts sclerosed.</p>

<p><i>The Worm.</i>&mdash;The chief peculiarity is its
irregular shape and its reproduction in the
larval stage by forming supernumerary heads,
which are supposed to wander about the
body.</p>

<p>The simplest forms are thread-like bodies,
flat or round, 3&nbsp;mm. long and 0Â·3&nbsp;mm. in
diameter, but they may be 12&nbsp;mm. long by
2Â·5&nbsp;mm. broad. The narrow end is the head,
which in life invaginates and evaginates, but
there is no indication of any suckers, except
an inconstant terminal depression. In addition
to these simple forms the most complicated and
irregular forms occur, due to the
formation of buds (heads) at various parts.
The detachment and growth of a head account for the presence of
more than one worm in a cyst. The irregularity in form is also<span class="pagenum" title="320"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a></span>
increased by the presence in the subcuticular tissue of the worm of
<i>reserve food bodies</i>. These bodies are supposed to be of this nature
and are spherical, 100&nbsp;Âµ to 300&nbsp;Âµ in diameter, but also much elongated.</p>

<p><i>Dipylidium caninum</i> is a
common intestinal parasite of
dogs, in which it grows larger
(<i>TÃ¦nia cucumerina</i>, Bloch)
than in cats (<i>T. elliptica</i>,
Batsch); it has, however, also
been found in jackals, as well
as in human beings, though
in the latter it is of comparatively
rare occurrence (twenty-four
cases), and almost always
affects children, generally of
tender age. One-third of all
the cases in children were
sucklings, about a quarter of
all the cases recorded were
adults, and these occurred
throughout all Europe with
the exception of Spain and
Italy.</p>

<p>The proglottids, which
leave the intestine spontaneously,
are recognizable by the
naked eye on account of their
form and reddish colour, as
well as their two genital pores. As a rule, the presence of this parasite
sets up no marked symptom in the patient.</p>

<p>The corresponding larval form (cysticercoid) lives in the louse
of the dog (<i>Trichodectes canis</i>), a fact that was first established by
Melnikow and Leuckart; according to Grassi and Rovelli, as well<span class="pagenum" title="323"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a></span>
as Sonsino, it also lives in the flea of the dog (<i>Ctenocephalus canis</i>)
and in the flea of man (<i>Pulex irritans</i>), but not in its larva. The
adult segments, which also leave the rectum of dogs and cats
spontaneously, creep about around the anus and get into the hair,
and are thus partly dried and disintegrated. Part of the segments, or
the oncospheres released by disintegration, are then taken up by lice
and fleas, within which they develop into larvÃ¦ (cysticercoids). Dogs
and cats are thus infected by their own skin parasites, which they bite
and swallow whilst gnawing at their fur. The infection of human
beings must occur in an analogous manner, by transmission of the
cysticercoids present on the lips or tongue of dogs when the latter lick
them, or it may be that the vermin of cats and dogs harbouring cysticercoids
are accidentally and directly swallowed by human beings.</p>

died of meningitis. For several years this was the only case, until
1885, since when numerous cases have come to light. Spooner (1873)
even reported a case from North America, which may, however, have
related to <i>Hymenolepis diminuta</i>. In Europe the worm is particularly
frequent in Sicily, but it has also been repeatedly observed in
North Italy; it has, moreover, been reported from Russia, Servia,
England, France, Germany, North and South America, the Philippines,
Siam and Japan, in all over 100 cases. Notwithstanding its
small size this worm causes considerable disorders in its hosts&mdash;mostly
children&mdash;as it sets up loss of appetite, diarrhÅa, various
nervous disturbances, and even epilepsy; all these symptoms, however,
disappear after the expulsion of the parasites, which are generally
present in large numbers.</p>

<p>The development as well as the manner of infection is still
unknown; Grassi is of opinion that <i>Hymenolepis nana</i> is indeed
merely a variety of <i>Hymenolepis murina</i>, Duj., which lives in rats.<span class="pagenum" title="325"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a></span>
According to Grassi direct development takes place with omission
of the intermediate host, but with the retention of the larval stage;
that is to say, rats infect themselves directly with <i>Hymenolepis murina</i>,
by ingesting the mature segments or oncospheres of this species, from
which subsequently the small larvÃ¦ originate in the intestinal wall
(fig.&nbsp;225); when fully developed they fall into the intestinal lumen
and become tapeworms. The identity of the two forms has nevertheless
been disputed (Moniez, R. Blanchard, v. Linstow), though their
near relationship cannot be denied. Grassi gave mature segments of
<i>Hymenolepis murina</i> to six persons, but only one person evacuated
a tapeworm. This, however, proves nothing in a district where<span class="pagenum" title="326"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a></span>
<i>Hymenolepis nana</i> frequently occurs in man; it was, moreover, not
possible to infect rats with segments of <i>Hymenolepis nana</i> (of man).
Accordingly this form may represent an independent species, which,
however, like <i>Hymenolepis murina</i>, also omits an intermediate host.</p>

Grassi, 1886.</p>

<p>This species measures 20 to 60&nbsp;cm. in length, and up to 3Â·5&nbsp;mm.
in breadth; there are from 600 to 1,000 segments. The head is very
small (0Â·2 to 0Â·5&nbsp;mm.), it is club-shaped and has
a rudimentary unarmed rostellum; the neck is short;
the mature segments are 3Â·5&nbsp;mm. in breadth, 0Â·66&nbsp;mm.
in length; the eggs are round or oval. The outer
egg-shell is yellowish and thickened, with indistinct
radial stripes; the inner embryonal shell (embryophore)
double, thin; the outer layer is somewhat
pointed at the poles; oncosphere 28&nbsp;Âµ by 36&nbsp;Âµ.
Between the inner and outer shells is a middle

<p><i>Hymenolepis diminuta</i> lives in the intestine of
rats&mdash;<i>Mus decumanus</i> (the sewer rat), <i>Mus rattus</i> (the
black rat), and <i>Mus alexandrinus</i>, rarely in mice; it
is occasionally also found in human beings.</p>

<p>Weinland described it from specimens collected
by Dr. E. Palmer in 1842, in Boston, from a child
aged 19 months, as <i>T. flavopunctata</i>. A second case
relating to a three year old child, from Philadelphia,
was only reported in 1889 by Leidy; a third case
was simultaneously reported of a two year old girl
in Varese (<i>T. varesina</i>); and Grassi
described another case relating to a
twelve year old girl from Catania
(Sicily). Sonsino and Previtera reported<span class="pagenum" title="327"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a></span>

(<i>Anisolabis annulipes</i>), and in coleoptera (<i>Acis spinosa</i> and <i>Scaurus

worms obtained, <i>i.e.</i>, about 4 per cent., thus corresponding to the infection
of the fleas. The development in the flea probably begins in the
pupal stage, the eggs being ingested by the older flea larvÃ¦. The larva
is 0Â·31 by 0Â·25&nbsp;mm.; tail 0Â·8&nbsp;mm., scolex 0Â·075 by 0Â·09&nbsp;mm., suckers,
0Â·055&nbsp;mm. in diameter. Microscopically it shows&mdash;(1) externally

(3) parenchymatous layer continuous with the tail, (4) fibrous layer
around the small caudal vesicle, then the parenchymatous scolex at

<p>Nicoll and Minchin (<i>loc. cit.</i>) found a cysticercoid<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> in the rat flea

Although this cycle, then, for <i>H. murina</i> also exists, it is not probable
that rats (or man in the case of <i>H. nana</i> if this be considered distinct)
infect themselves in this way, as they hardly
ingest all the necessary fleas to account for the
massive infection which frequently exists in
rats (and man), so that Grassiâs cycle holds
good as the predominant method. <i>Xenopsylla
cheopis</i> has also been found by Johnston to
harbour both cysticercoids in Australia.</p>

<p>This worm measures 25 to 30&nbsp;cm. in length; the head has four
large round suckers; the rostellum has ninety hooks (18&nbsp;Âµ in length);
there are 500 to 700 segments, of which the last 100 are filled
with eggs and form half of the entire worm. The segments, when
mature, measure 2&nbsp;mm. in length by 1Â·4&nbsp;mm. in breadth; genital
pores unilateral; about fifty testes; the uterus consists of a number of<span class="pagenum" title="330"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a></span>
loops, which at each side are rolled up into an almost spherical ball;
when filled with eggs the convolutions unwind, permeate the segment
and then lose their wall; the eggs lying free in the parenchyma
become finally surrounded, one, or several together, by proliferating
parenchymatous cells; this is how the 300 to 400 egg masses, taking
up the entire mature segment, are formed. The globular oncosphere
(8&nbsp;Âµ) is surrounded by two perfectly transparent shells, the outer of
which terminates in two pointed processes.</p>

<p><i>Davainea madagascariensis</i> has hitherto been found in man only

twenty-two to thirty-two in number, usually twenty-six to twenty-eight;
large and small hooks alternate regularly; the length of the large hooks
is 0Â·16 to 0Â·18&nbsp;mm., of the small ones 0Â·11 to 0Â·14&nbsp;mm. The rostellum

The proglottids, the number of which averages from 800 to 900, increase

The genital pores alternate fairly evenly at the lateral margin a little
behind the middle of each segment. The fully developed uterus consists
of a median trunk, with seven to ten lateral branches at either side,
some of which are again ramified. The eggs are oval, the egg-shell
very thin and delicate; the embryonal shell (embryophore) is thick,
with radial stripes; it is of a pale yellowish colour, globular, and

<p>In its fully developed condition <i>T. solium</i> is found exclusively
in man; the head is usually attached in the anterior third of the
small intestine and the chain, in numerous convolutions, extends
backwards; a few mature detached proglottids usually lie at the
most posterior part, and these are usually evacuated during defÃ¦cation.
In exceptional cases single proglottids or whole worms may
reach contiguous organs if abnormal communications with them
exist; thus they may reach the abdominal cavity and the urinary
bladder, or they may be found in a so-called worm abscess of the
peritoneum; occasionally, in vomiting, single segments or several
together may be brought up. Exceptionally it induces severe anÃ¦mia.</p>

<p>The <i>larval stage</i> (<i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i>) that gives rise to <i>TÃ¦nia
solium</i> lives normally in the intramuscular connective tissue and
other organs of the domestic pig, but it is known to exist also in
a few other mammals, such as the wild boar, the sheep,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> the stag,
dog, cat, brown bear and monkey, as well as in man. The cysticercus<span class="pagenum" title="333"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a></span>

<p>Numerous experiments have proved that the <i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i>
of the pig, if introduced into the intestine of man, grows to a <i>TÃ¦nia
solium</i> (KÃ¼chenmeister, 1855; Humbert, 1856; Leuckart, 1856; Hollenbach,
1859; Heller, 1876); the cysticercus has frequently also been
cultivated purposely by feeding pigs with mature proglottids of
<i>T. solium</i> (P.&nbsp;J. van Beneden, 1853; Haubner and KÃ¼chenmeister,
1855; Leuckart, 1856; Mosler, 1865; Gerlach, 1870; etc.), but success
did not attend the efforts to make <i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i> establish themselves
in the intestines of pigs, dogs, guinea-pigs, rabbits and monkeys
(<i>Macacus cynomolgus</i>), and so become adult TÃ¦niÃ¦; the attempts, also,
to infect dogs with cysticerci by means of ova were likewise, as a
rule, abortive.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="334"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>The development of <i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i> takes two and a half to three or four
months; it is not known how long the cysticerci remain alive in animals; not uncommonly
they perish at earlier or later stages, and become calcified or caseated.
Extracted cysticerci die in water at a temperature of 47Â° to 48Â°&nbsp;C., in flesh at normal
temperature they remain alive for twenty-nine days or more. On account of the
present rapid means of pickling and smoking meat, the cysticerci as a rule are not
killed, also the effect of cold on them for some time in cold chambers of slaughterhouses
is not lethal, but freezing is fatal (Ostertag).</p></div>

<p>There is not the least doubt that human beings are almost exclusively
infected with <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i> by eating pork containing cysticerci
in a condition that does not endanger the life of the cysticerci. The
infection may likewise be caused in man by eating the infected meat
of other animals subject to this species of bladder worm, mainly, as a
matter of fact, deer and wild boar.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The frequency of cysticerci in pigsâ flesh has considerably decreased since the

1 infected pig to every 305 slaughtered between 1876 to 1882; from 1886 to 1889, there

in 1895 there was 1 to every 2,049, and in 1896 only 1 infected pig was found of
5,886 slaughtered. In South Germany pigs with cysticerci are very rare, but are
more frequent in the eastern provinces of Prussia; in 1892 the number of infected
pigs compared with the total slaughtered was as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The average for the whole of Prussia in the same year was 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1,290; for the
eastern provinces, on the other hand, 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;604. Even more unfavourable are the proportions
in Russian Poland (over 1 per cent. of pigs measly), in Prague (over 3 per
cent.), in Bosnia and Herzegovina (6 to 7 per cent.). The cause for this is most
likely attributable to the manner in which the pigs are kept. When allowed to be
in the farmyards of the small farmers for the whole day, or allowed to wander in the
village streets and pasture lands, they are more liable to take up the oncospheres of
the <i>T. solium</i> than when shut up in good pig-styes.</p></div>

<p>The geographical distribution of <i>T. solium</i> generally corresponds
with that of the domestic pig and the custom of eating pork in any
form insufficiently cooked or raw. There are, or were, some isolated
districts in Germany, France, Italy and England where the âarmed
tapewormâ was frequent (for instance, Thuringia, Brunswick, Saxony,
Hesse, Westphalia, whereas it is and was very scarce in South Germany);
it is thus easily understood why it occurs very rarely in the
East, in Asia and in Africa, in consequence of the Mahommedans,<span class="pagenum" title="335"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a></span>
Jews, etc., not eating pork. In North America, also, <i>T. solium</i> is very
rare; the tapeworm which is known there by this name is generally
<i>T. saginata</i>, Stiles. During the last decade <i>T. solium</i> infection has,
however, very markedly decreased in North and East Germany in
consequence of the precautions exercised by the public in the choice
of pork to avoid trichinosis, especially, however, because measly meat
must be sold as such and must be thoroughly cooked before being
placed on the market; indeed, if badly infected it may not be sold
for food, but can be turned to account for industrial purposes.</p>

<p>The occurrence of <i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i> in man has been known
since 1558 (Rumler, <i>Obs. med.</i>, liii, p.&nbsp;32); there is hardly an organ
in man in which cysticerci have not been observed at some time;
they are most frequently found in the brain,<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> where they grow to a
variety known as <i>Cysticercus racemosus</i>; next in frequency they are
found in the eye, in the muscular system, in the heart, in the subcutaneous
connective tissue, the liver, lungs, abdominal cavity, etc.
The number of cysticerci observed in one man varies between a few
and several thousands. Of the sexes, men are most subject (60 to
66 per cent. of the number attacked). The disturbances caused in
man by cysticerci vary according to the nature or position of the
organs attacked; when situated in the cerebral meninges they have
the same effect as tumours.</p>

<p>During the last decades, however, these cases have also become
less common. In Rudolphiâs time 2 per cent. of <i>post-mortems</i> in
Berlin showed cysticerci; in the âsixties, according to Virchow, about
the same; in 1875 the number fell to 1Â·6 per cent.; in 1881 to 0Â·5 per
cent.; in 1882 to 0Â·2 per cent.; in 1900 to 0Â·15 per cent., and in 1903
to 0Â·16 per cent. Hirschberg between 1869 and 1885 discovered
cysticerci in the eye seventy times in 60,000 ophthalmic cases, but
during the following six years the parasite was only present twice
amongst a total of 46,000 cases of ophthalmic diseases, and since
1895 no ophthalmic case has been met with.</p>

<p>The infection of human beings with the cysticerci can only take
place by the introduction of the oncospheres of <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i> into
the stomach with vegetable foods, salads that have been washed
in impure water containing oncospheres, also by drinking contaminated
water; the carriers of <i>T. solium</i>, moreover, infect themselves
still more frequently through uncleanliness in defÃ¦cation, the privies<span class="pagenum" title="336"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a></span>
in public localities and many private houses affording striking testimony
of this. The minute oncospheres can thus easily reach the
fingers and thence the mouth (as in twirling the moustache, biting the
nail). More rarely a third manner of transmission or internal auto-infection
may possibly take place, as when, in the act of vomiting,
mature proglottids near the stomach are drawn into it; the oncospheres
or segments there retained are then in the same position as
if they had been introduced through the mouth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On account of these dangers of internal or external auto-infection, it is therefore
the duty of the medical attendant, after recognizing the presence of tapeworms, to
expel them,<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> and in doing so to employ every possible means to prevent vomiting
setting in; it is, however, equally important to take the necessary steps to destroy
the parasites evacuated. It may be incidentally mentioned that in using certain
remedies the scolex not rarely remains in the intestine; the cure in such cases has
not been accomplished, as the scolex again produces new proglottids, and after
about eleven weeks the first formed ones are again mature and appear in the fÃ¦ces.</p>

<p>Amongst the cysticerci also many malformations appear; thus absence of the
rostellum and the hooks, or double formation with six suckers, or abnormalities of
growth on account of the surroundings, which have had a special name given to
them, <i>viz.</i>, <i>Cysticercus racemosus</i>, Zenk. (= <i>C. botryoides</i>, Hell.; <i>C. multilocularis</i>,
Kchnmstr.); these forms are more especially found at the base of the brain, are
irregularly ramified and often without the head.</p></div>

<p>A certain interest is attached to those forms that have led to the
establishment of a distinct <span class="nowrap">species:&mdash;</span></p>


<p class="spec"><b>Cysticercus acanthotrias</b>, Weinld., 1858.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In making the autopsy of a white Virginian woman who had died of phthisis, a
cysticercus was found in the dura mater, and eleven or twelve specimens in the
muscles and subcutaneous tissue. Weinland and Leuckart, who examined the
specimens, found that they resembled <i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i> in form and size, but that
they carried on the rostellum a triple crown, each consisting of fourteen to sixteen
hooks, which differed from the hooks of <i>C. cellulosÃ¦</i> or of <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i> by the
greater length of the posterior root process and the more slender form of the
hooks; the large hooks measured 0Â·153 to 0Â·196&nbsp;mm., the medium-sized hooks,
0Â·114 to 0Â·14&nbsp;mm., and the small ones 0Â·063 to 0Â·07&nbsp;mm.</p></div>

<p>On account of these differences a distinct species of cysticercus
was established, and this naturally presupposed a corresponding
species of TÃ¦nia (<i>T. acanthotrias</i>, Lkt.); this could be done with<span class="pagenum" title="337"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a></span>
justice so long as the case remained isolated, <i>i.e.</i>, in America, as
there was the possibility of the corresponding TÃ¦nia being found. In
this respect, however, the position has changed; Delore first described
a cysticercus the size of a nut from the biceps muscle of the arm of
a silk-worker in Lyons; according to Bertolis this specimen possessed
hooks of three different sizes, the dimensions of which corresponded
with the figures given by Weinland and Leuckart; the correctness of
the diagnosis could hardly be doubted, as Bertolis was known to be
a very exact observer. A second case has become known through
Cobbold, who regards a specimen of a cysticercus in Dallingerâs
collection as likewise belonging to <i>Cysticercus acanthotrias</i>; this
specimen also came from a manâs brain; finally a third case, also
from France, has been published by Redon. This author, amongst
numerous <i>C. cellulosÃ¦</i> of a man, found one that had forty-one hooks in
three rows, and he was the first to express the opinion that <i>C. acanthotrias</i>
does not represent a distinct species, but is only an abnormality
of <i>C. cellulosÃ¦</i>. This view was also taken by Blanchard and Railliet, and
is probably correct, as the discovery of the large corresponding TÃ¦nia
furnished with three rows of hooks is not to be expected in European
beasts of prey, and in Redonâs case <i>C. acanthotrias</i> as well as <i>C. cellulosÃ¦</i>
occurred simultaneously.</p>

<p>The duration of life of <i>C. cellulosÃ¦</i> in man is very long; cysticerci
of the eye have been known to persist for twenty years, and in cysticercus
of the brain ten to nineteen years may elapse from the first
appearance of cerebral symptoms until death. Dead cysticerci may
shrivel up or become calcified, perhaps also undergo fatty degeneration
and then absorption. Finally, it may be mentioned that if particular
proof is required that <i>C. cellulosÃ¦</i> of man belongs to the cycle of
development of the <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i>, such proof has been furnished by
Redon.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;<i>TÃ¦nia tenella</i>, mentioned on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_332">332</a>, was ascribed by Cobbold to
cysticerci of the muscular system of sheep. It has, however, been demonstrated
that these cysticerci belong to the cycle of development of <i>TÃ¦nia marginata</i>
(dog) (<i>Cysticercus tenuicollis</i>, from the omentum of sheep); but as already stated
<i>C. cellulosÃ¦</i> also occurs in sheep. Chatin himself swallowed the cysticercus, which
Cobbold termed <i>C. ovis</i>, without causing a TÃ¦nia to develop in his intestine. MÃ¼ller
also vainly sought to induce infection with <i>C. tenuicollis</i> in his own person. On the
other hand, the feeding of a dog with <i>Cysticercus ovis</i> resulted in the production of
<i>TÃ¦nia marginata</i>.</p></div>

<p>This species, which in structure resembles <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i>, lives in the intestine
of the dog and the wolf. It attains 1Â·5 to 4&nbsp;m. in length, possesses a double crown
of thirty to forty hooks, on
an average thirty-six to thirty-eight
hooks, and in its larval
stage (<i>Cysticercus tenuicollis</i>)
lives in the peritoneal cavity of
ruminants and the pig, occasionally
in the monkey and squirrel.</p>

<p>It is included in this work
because, according to one statement,
<i>C. tenuicollis</i> is supposed
to have been observed in man
in North America; but the case
is not quite certain, as the number of hooks was less than in <i>C. tenuicollis</i> and
coincided with <i>C. cellulosÃ¦</i>, although the size of the cysticercus appeared to point to
<i>C. tenuicollis</i>. A yet earlier statement of Eschricht, that <i>Cysticercus tenuicollis</i> had
been observed in Iceland in the liver of a man, is undoubtedly due to an error.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>TÃ¦nia serrata</b>, Goeze, 1782.</p>

<p>This parasite attains a length of from 0Â·5 to 2&nbsp;m., possesses a double crown of
thirty-four to forty-eight (mostly forty) hooks. It lives exclusively in the intestine
of the dog, the corresponding cysticercus (<i>Cysticercus pisiformis</i>) living in the
mesentery of the hare and rabbit. We mention this species with all reserve
amongst the parasites of man, because Vital states that he has observed it twice in
Constantine (Algeria) in human beings. The data, however, are not sufficient to
characterize the species. It is highly probable that they relate to <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i>.
Galli-Valerio even swallowed five specimens of <i>Cysticercus pisiformis</i>, but without
result.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>TÃ¦nia crassicollis</b>, Rud., 1810.</p>

<p>I only mention this species from the intestine of the domestic cat because
Krabbe regards its occurrence in man as possible. It attains a length of 60&nbsp;cm.
and is armed; its cysticercus (<i>Cysticercus fasciolaris</i>) lives in the liver of mice and
rats. In Jutland, according to Krabbe, chopped-up mice (spread on bread) are
eaten raw, being a national remedy for retention of urine, and this custom affords
the possibility of the introduction of <i>C. fasciolaris</i> into the intestine of man (<i>Nord.

<p>The length of the entire tapeworm averages 4 to 8 to 10&nbsp;m. and
more, even up to 36&nbsp;m. According to BÃ©renger-Feraud it attains
a length of 74&nbsp;m. (?) The head is cubical in shape, 1Â·5 to 2&nbsp;mm.
in diameter; the suckers are hemispherical (0Â·8&nbsp;mm.) and are
frequently pigmented; there is a sucker-like organ in place of the
rostellum, and this also is frequently pigmented. The neck is
moderately long and about half the breadth of the head; the
proglottids, the number of which averages more than 1,000,
gradually increase in size; the mature detached segments are shaped
exactly like pumpkin-seeds, and are about 16 to 20&nbsp;mm. in length
and 4 to 7&nbsp;mm. in breadth. The genital pores alternate irregularly
and are situated somewhat behind the middle of the lateral margin.
There are twenty to thirty-five
lateral branches at each side of the
median trunk of the uterus, and
these again ramify. The eggs are
more or less globular, the egg-shell
frequently remains intact and
carries one or two filaments; the
embryonal shell (embryophore) is thick, radially striated, is transparent
and oval; it is 30&nbsp;Âµ to 40&nbsp;Âµ in length, and 20&nbsp;Âµ to 30&nbsp;Âµ in breadth.
Several segments simultaneously are usually passed spontaneously

<i>T. fenestrata</i> for fenestrated specimens. Moreover, <i>T. solium</i>, var. <i>abietina</i>, Weinld.,
1858, which was evacuated by an Indian, was probably a <i>T. saginata</i> with somewhat
close uterine branches. It is regarded by Stiles and Goldberger as a doubtful subspecies.</p></div>

requires from three to six months for its development. Numerous
experiments have confirmed the connection of <i>Cysticercus bovis</i> with
<i>TÃ¦nia saginata</i>; indeed, the cysticercus was only discovered by feeding
experiments after attention had been called to the ox as the probable
intermediary host of this TÃ¦nia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Medical men observed that weakly children who were ordered to eat raw scraped
beef to strengthen them contracted <i>T. saginata</i>. It was found, moreover, that
Jews, who are prohibited from eating pork from religious motives, suffered especially
from <i>T. saginata</i>; when <i>T. solium</i> was found to occur in a Jew he often confessed
to having eaten pork; and finally it was found that certain nations&mdash;for
instance, the Abyssinians&mdash;frequently harbour <i>T. saginata</i>, and only eat beef&mdash;raw
by preference.</p>

<p>These observations led Leuckart, in 1861, to feed
young calves with the proglottids of <i>T. saginata</i> in
order to discover the corresponding cysticercus, which
was then not known. This experiment was successful.
Similar experiments, with similar results, were then conducted
by Mosler (1863), Cobbold and Simonds (1864
and 1872), RÃ¶ll (1865), Gerlach (1870), ZÃ¼rn (1872),
Saint Cyr, JolicÅur (1873), Masse and Pourquier
(1876), and Perroncito, in 1876. The attempts to
infect goats, sheep, dogs, pigs, rabbits and monkeys
were unsuccessful. Only Zenker and Heller were able
to infect kids, and Heller infected one sheep, but these
are exceptions.</p></div>

<p>Artificial infections of human beings with
<i>Cysticercus bovis</i> to obtain the tapeworm were
less numerous, and indeed quite superfluous,
yet this was also done by Oliver (1869) in India,
and Perroncito (1877) in Italy. The experiments
of the latter prove that the extracted
cysticerci of the ox certainly perish in water at
47Â° to 48Â°&nbsp;C.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is a remarkable circumstance that, at least as
regards Central Europe, <i>C. bovis</i> in the ox, after natural
infection, was so seldom found that almost every case
was published as a rarity; whereas the TÃ¦nia is very frequent in man. The
reason for this is that in Germany cattle are not severely infected, and that the
small, easily dried-up cysticerci easily escape notice in the large body of the host.
Hertwig, the late director of the town cattle market in Berlin, in 1888, pointed out<span class="pagenum" title="341"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a></span>
that the cysticercus of the ox is found chiefly in the musculi pterygoide externi
and interni, and since that time a far greater number of infected oxen have been
found in Berlin.</p>

<p>Since 1892 an increase has taken place in the number of oxen infected with
cysticercus, but this is probably attributable to the more general and searching
examinations. In the slaughter-houses of Prussia the number of infected beasts was
as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The condition was most frequent in Neisse (3Â·2 to 4 per cent.), Eisenach
(1Â·91 per cent.), Ohlau (1Â·57 per cent.), Oels i. Schles. (1 per cent.), Marienwerder
(0Â·34 to 1Â·2 per cent.). The flesh of oxen only slightly infected (containing not more
than ten living cysticerci) is sold in pieces of not more than 5&nbsp;lb. to consumers
after having been rendered innocuous by cooking, or by pickling for twenty-one days
in 25 per cent. salt brine, or hanging for twenty-one days in suitable refrigerators;
oxen in which only one cysticercus is found are allowed free commerce, and those
strongly infected (<i>i.e.</i>, containing more than ten living cysticerci) may only be used
for industrial purposes.</p>

<p>It is a striking fact that more bulls than cows are infected (according to Reissmann,
in Berlin, from 1895 to 1902, 0Â·446 per cent. bulls, 0Â·439 per cent. oxen, and
0Â·262 per cent. cows), the explanation of which, according to Ostertag, is that most
oxen are killed when young, when also infection most readily takes place, and,
further, that the larva later on in life can be completely atrophied.</p></div>

<p>The cysticercus of the ox has hitherto been found in man on very
rare occasions. Arndt (<i>Zeitschr. f. Psychiat.</i>, xxiv) mentions a case in
the brain, Heller in the eye, and Nabiers and Dubreith also in the
brain (<i>Journ. mÃ©d. Bordeaux</i>, 1889â1890, p.&nbsp;209); but the diagnoses
are not quite certain, as absence of hooks occasionally occurs in
<i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i>.</p>

<p><i>TÃ¦nia saginata</i> is the most frequent tapeworm of man (with the
exception of <i>Dibothriocephalus latus</i> in a few districts), and the parasite
is widely distributed over the surface of the globe; it has been known
in the East for ages, so far as data are available; it is frequent in
Africa, America, and Europe. Its frequency has perceptibly increased
during the last few years, but a decrease should soon take place in<span class="pagenum" title="342"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a></span>
consequence of the extent and improvement of the official inspection
of meat.</p>

<p><i>TÃ¦nia echinococcus</i> measures 2Â·5 to 5 or 6&nbsp;mm. in length; the head

genital pores alternate; there are forty to fifty testicles; the vas deferens<span class="pagenum" title="345"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a></span>
is spirally coiled; the cirrus pouch is pyriform. The ovary is horseshoe-shaped
with the concavity directed backwards; the vitellarium
double, each half almost bean-shaped, at
right angles to the plane of the segment;
the shell gland is round. The median trunk
of the uterus is dilated when filled with eggs
and (instead of lateral branches) has lateral
diverticula. It is not unusual for the eggs
to form local heaps. The embryonal shell
(embryophore) is moderately thin, with radial
striÃ¦, almost globular, 30&nbsp;Âµ to 36&nbsp;Âµ in
diameter.</p>

<p>When mature this parasite lives in the
small intestine of the domestic dog, the
jackal, and the wolf, and apparently also in
<i>Felis concolor</i>, and is usually present in great
numbers; it can also be transmitted experimentally
to the domestic cat, one successful
result out of seven (DÃ©vÃ©).<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> The
larval stage (<i>Echinococcus polymorphus</i>) lives
in various organs&mdash;chiefly in the liver and
lungs&mdash;of numerous species of mammals
(twenty-seven), especially in sheep, ox and
pig, and it is even not uncommon in man,
though the TÃ¦nia itself has never been found
in a human being; accordingly man can only
acquire the echinococcus by ingesting the
eggs of the âdog worm.â The dogs disseminate
the eggs of <i>TÃ¦nia echinococcus</i>
wherever they go, or carry them to their
mouths and coats by biting up the
evacuated segments, and are thus able to
transmit them directly to human beings (by
licking them or making use of the same
crockery, etc.). In other cases the oncospheres,
enclosed in the embryophores, must
withstand desiccation for a time and then
(as when the dogs are âkissedâ or otherwise
caressed) are transmitted into or on to<span class="pagenum" title="346"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a></span>
man. As echinococcus disease in man is always very dangerous, it
would be a matter of general interest to prevent dogs being infected
by destroying the echinococci,<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> and all measures would be justifiable
which would diminish the superfluous number of house-dogs (for
instance, high taxes); measures should also be adopted to limit the
association of men with dogs, particularly in such frequented places
as restaurants, railway carriages and tram-cars.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Echinococcus is very common in slaughtered animals; in Germany, however,
the figures in the reports of the abattoirs present an erroneous view in so far as,
besides the total number of animals slaughtered, only the numbers of those organs
(liver and lungs) are published that were so severely infected with echinococci that,
even when the parasites were âshelledâ out, the flesh could not be placed upon the
market and was therefore âcondemned.â</p>

<p>An echinococcus is a spherical or roundish bladder full of a
watery liquid, which originates by liquefaction of the oncosphere, and
in man may attain the size of a childâs head, but remains smaller in
cattle (the size of an orange or apple). The thin wall of the bladder
is composed of an external laminated cuticle (ectocyst) and an internal
germinal or parenchymatous layer (endocyst). The latter again<span class="pagenum" title="348"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a></span>
exhibits two layers: an outer layer of small cells that are less sharply
defined, and an inner layer of larger cells. It contains, in addition,
calcareous corpuscles, muscular fibres and excretory vessels. It is
rich in glycogen.</p>

<p>The development in cattle often remains stationary at the bladder
stage, and they are then called âacephalocysts,â or <i>Echinococcus cysticus
sterilis</i>. According to Lichtenheld, sterile cysts occur in 80 per cent.
of cases in cattle, in 20 per cent. in pigs, and in 7Â·5 per cent. in sheep.
In other cases large numbers of small, hollow <span class="lowercase smcap">BROOD CAPSULES</span> are
formed in the germ layer, but are not arranged in any particular order.
The order of the layers is just the reverse in them to what it is in the
parent cyst, that is to say, they have inside a thin non-laminated cuticle
and the parenchymatous layer on their external surface. These,
theoretically at least, may be regarded as invaginations of the bladder
wall giving rise to a cavity with the cuticle internal and the
parenchymatous layer external. If we suppose the orifice to close,
we should then get an isolated
cavity with cuticle internal and
parenchymatous layer external, as
in the brood capsule (fig.&nbsp;252).
If we next suppose an evagination of the wall of the brood capsule to
occur at one point we should get a hollow process <i>lined</i> with cuticle;
at the bottom of this we get the scolex and hooklets formed, and a
little higher up the tube the suckers (fig.&nbsp;252, 4). If this hollow scolex
is now pictured as being invaginated we get a hollow scolex <i>covered</i>
with cuticle and lined by a parenchymatous layer projecting into the
cavity of the brood capsule. The two sides of this hollow scolex now
fuse and we get a solid scolex projecting into the cavity. Finally, if
we imagine once more the rostellum and suckers invaginated into the
posterior part of the scolex we get the condition as frequently found
in the brood capsules, <i>i.e.</i>, a scolex covered with cuticle projecting into
the cavity, with the rostellum and suckers invaginated into the posterior
portion of the scolex (fig.&nbsp;252<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>, 7).</p>

<p>A large hydatid may contain many thousands of brood capsules.
Each brood capsule is about as big as a pinâs head, and may contain
ten to thirty or more scolices. The delicate wall of the brood capsules
may rupture, so that the scolices are now free in the mother cyst. These
free scolices and also free brood capsules constitute what is known as
âhydatid sand,â which settles at the bottom of a glass when hydatid
fluid is poured into it. This form occurs chiefly in domesticated
animals and is termed <i>E. veterinorum</i>, Rud., or <i>E. cysticus fertilis</i>.</p>

<p>In man, and only rarely in cattle, the mother cyst first forms
âdaughter cystsâ (<i>E. hominis</i>, Rud. [fig.&nbsp;255]), which, though smaller
than the âmother cyst,â resemble
it in the structure of
their walls; thus they are
covered externally by a laminated
cuticle and internally
by the parenchymatous layer.
They originate:</p>

<p>(1) Between the laminÃ¦ of the cuticle of the mother cyst from
small, detached portions of the parenchymatous layer; during their
growth they bulge inwardly or outwardly and may separate themselves
entirely from their parent cyst. In the latter case they lie
between the mother cyst and the capsule of connective tissue
formed by the host (<i>E. granulosus</i> or <i>E. hydatidosus exogenus</i>);
when growing inwardly they reach the interior of the mother cyst
(<i>E. hydatidosus endogenus</i>). Their number is very variable and does
not depend on the size of the mother cyst. They are as big as, or
bigger than, gooseberries.</p>

</div>

<p>(2) According to some authors, endogenous daughter cysts arise also<span class="pagenum" title="351"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a></span>
from a <i>metamorphosis of scolices</i> that have separated off from the brood
capsule. This takes place in the following way: Fluid accumulates
in the interior of the scolex, so that eventually nothing remains except
a sac consisting of cuticle lined by parenchyma. The cuticle gradually
thickens and several layers form (fig.&nbsp;257).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>(3) <i>Transformation of Brood Capsules into Daughter Cysts.</i>&mdash;This is
also held to be possible by various observers. New epithelial layers are
deposited between the cuticle
which lines the brood capsule
and the outer parenchymatous
layer. This parenchymatous
layer gradually disappears and a
new parenchymatous layer forms
in the interior from the parenchyma
of the scolex or scolices.
Although it appears strange that
a completely formed scolex with
specifically differentiated tissues
and organs should retrogress
to more primitively organized
matter, and again become a
proliferating bladder, yet we can
hardly doubt that the older observations, regarding such a vesicular
metamorphosis, of Bremser (1819), v. Siebold (1837), Naunyn (1862),
Rasmusser (1866), Leuckart (1881), Alexinsky (1898), Riemann (1899),
DÃ©vÃ© (1901), and Perroncito (1902) are correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="352"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a></span></p>

<p>(4) Further, <i>a fourth method</i> of formation of daughter cysts is
described by Naunyn as occurring in sterile hydatids, <i>i.e.</i>, those containing
no brood capsules. In this case a portion of the mother wall
of the hydatid gets constricted off.</p>

<p>It has also been established that not only daughter cysts transplanted
into animals develop further (Lebedeff, Andrejew, Stadnitzky, Alexinsky,
Riemann), but that this also holds good if only hydatid <i>scolices</i> from<span class="pagenum" title="353"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a></span>
man or animals are transplanted into animals (rabbits). They develop
into echinococci and can then give rise to brood capsules and scolices.
As DÃ©vÃ© further established, hydatid <i>scolices</i> are not capable of
developing in guinea-pigs, while corresponding experiments with
rabbits are in the large majority of cases successful where the scolices
are introduced subcutaneously or into the pleural or peritoneal cavities.
It is only in the case of <i>daughter cysts</i> that further growth is obtained
in the case of guinea-pigs. Finally it appears, as has been already
stated, that brood capsules can transform themselves into daughter
cysts, but according to DÃ©vÃ© only within the mother cyst, not after
transplantation. Daughter cysts that have been formed in the mother
cyst of man and animals behave themselves just as the mother cyst
does, <i>i.e.</i>, they can remain sterile,
or give rise to brood capsules
and scolices, or even again
to fresh cysts&mdash;granddaughter
cysts. The mother cyst can also die, so that the daughter cysts then
lie in the cavity of the connective tissue capsule. The number of the
daughter cysts in either case may attain several thousands.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The echinococcus fluid, which originally is formed from the blood of the host, is
light yellow, with a neutral or slightly acid reaction; its specific gravity averages 1009
to 1015. It contains about 1Â·5 per cent. of inorganic salts, half of which is common
salt; in addition (besides water) it contains sugar, inosite, leucine, tyrosin, succinic
acid (associated with lime or soda) and albumens which are not coagulated by heat;
occasionally also the fluid has been found to contain hÃ¦matoidin and uric acid salts
(in echinococcus of the kidneys), which doubtless demonstrates that the echinococcus
liquid originates from the host. It has been generally assumed that echinococcus
fluid contains a toxic substance the escape of which into the body cavity (at operation
or by bursting of a hydatid cyst) produces more or less severe symptoms (fever,
peritonitis, urticaria), so much so that one speaks of hydatid intoxication. The<span class="pagenum" title="354"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a></span>
investigations of Kobert, Joest, etc., have, however, shown the harmlessness of fresh
undecomposed hydatid and cysticercus fluid for rabbits, mice and guinea-pigs, whether
inoculated intraperitoneally, subcutaneously or intravenously. Contrary data or
clinical experience must accordingly depend on other factors.</p></div>

<p>According to the researches of Leuckart, the growth of the
echinococcus is very slow; four weeks after infection the average
size is only 0Â·25 to 0Â·35&nbsp;mm., at the age of eight weeks it is 1 to
2Â·5&nbsp;mm., and at this period the formation of the central cavity commences;
at the age of five months, and with a size of 15 to 20&nbsp;mm.,
the first brood capsules with scolices are formed. The consequence
of this gradual increase of size is that the organ attacked
can maintain its functions by vicarious hypertrophy, and that many
echinococci induce no special symptoms and cannot even be
diagnosed, the latter circumstance being due to their hidden position.</p>

<p>The echinococcus cannot be said to be scarce in man, as is
shown by the following table for Central <span class="nowrap">Europe:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>These, however, are only cases that have become known by <i>post-mortem</i>;
in addition, there are cases that have been treated medically,
of which there are a few statements, at all events relating to the
principal districts of Germany. According to Madelung, one case
of echinococcus occurs in every 1,056 inhabitants in the town of
Rostock, in the district of Rostock one to every 1,283, in Schwerin
one to every 5,887, and in Ludwigsort one to every 23,685; according
to Peiper, in Upper Pomerania one case occurs to every 3,336,
in the district of Greifswald one to every 1,535 inhabitants. The
northern districts of Pomerania are more affected than the southern
ones.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Accordingly, echinococcus is also considerably more frequent in cattle in
Pomerania. On an average in Germany 10Â·39 per cent. oxen, 9Â·83 per cent. sheep,
and 6Â·47 per cent. pigs are infected, whereas in Upper Pomerania 37Â·73 per cent.<span class="pagenum" title="355"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a></span>
oxen, 27Â·1 per cent. sheep, and 12Â·8 per cent. pigs are infected; in Greifswald, indeed,
64Â·58 per cent. oxen, 51Â·02 per cent. sheep, but only 4Â·93 per cent. pigs are infected.
In accordance with these figures <i>TÃ¦nia echinococcus</i> must be frequent in dogs in
Pomerania, especially in Upper Pomerania; on the other hand, the conjecture that
the frequency of echinococcus in Mecklenburg is explained by the occurrence of
<i>TÃ¦nia echinococcus</i> in foxes has not been confirmed, as the fox does not harbour this
worm in Mecklenburg.</p></div>

<p>Beyond the European continent, echinococcus is frequent in
the inhabitants of Iceland, Argentine, Paraguay and Australia. In
Iceland, according to Finsen, 1 in every 43 inhabitants is affected
with echinococcus; according to Jonassen the proportion is 1 to 63;
this is due to the habits of the people of Iceland or, in fact,
to the frequency of <i>TÃ¦nia echinococcus</i>
in dogs, and the prevalence
of the hydatid in cattle. In certain
districts of Australia it is
just as frequent. In Cape Colony,
Egypt and Algeria echinococcus
is not rare, but it is scarce in
America and in Asia, with the
exception of the nomadic tribes
of Lake Baikal.</p>

<p>Echinococcus attacks persons
of every age, though it is rare in
children up to 10 years of age
and in old people. It occurs
most frequently between the ages
of 21 and 40 years. According
to all statistics it preponderates
in women (about two-thirds of the
cases). The liver is its favourite
seat (57Â·1 per cent. of the cases);
next in order come the lungs
(8 per cent.), kidneys (6 per cent.),
cranial cavity, genitalia, organs of circulation, spleen (3Â·8 per cent.), etc.
As a rule one organ only is invaded; multiple occurrence may originate
from one infection, or eventually from a later infection (?), or it may
come to pass that from some cause (through the spontaneous rupture of
an echinococcus, or the rupture of one caused by an injury or surgical
operation) daughter cysts, brood capsules or scolices escape into the
abdominal cavity,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> where they settle or become transformed and go<span class="pagenum" title="356"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a></span>
on growing. In the distribution of this secondary echinococcus the
great powers of motility of the free scolices must be taken into
account (SabrazÃ¨s, Muratet, and Husnot).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Human echinococci may also die at various stages of development, become
caseous or calcified, or may be absorbed, the cause for this being either disease of
the hydatid itself or inflammation of its connective tissue capsule; the discovery of
the laminated cuticle, which has great powers of resistance, or the finding of the
hooklets of the scolices is sufficient to form a conclusion as to the nature of such
formations.</p></div>

<p>Siebold (1853) was the first to rear <i>TÃ¦nia echinococcus</i> in the dog
by feeding it with the echinococcus of cattle and especially of sheep.
KÃ¼chenmeister, van Beneden, Leuckart, Railliet and others obtained
similar results, and Thomas, Naunyn, Krabbe and Finsen succeeded
in rearing <i>T. echinococcus</i> in dogs from the bladder worms of human
beings; these grow comparatively slowly (one to three months<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a>) and
only during the process of growth develop their hooklets in their
definite form (fig.&nbsp;258). It lies in the nature of things that dogs,
whether experimentally or naturally infected, almost always harbour
<i>T. echinococcus</i> in large quantities. That cats exceptionally harbour
these worms has been already mentioned (DÃ©vÃ©). Finally, Leuckart
infected young pigs by feeding them with mature segments.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Echinococcus multilocularis</b> (alveolar colloid).</p>

<p>In addition to the form of echinococcus already described, and
which is also frequently termed <i>Echinococcus unilocularis</i>, there is a
second form which occurs in man as well as in animals, and which
is termed <i>E. multilocularis</i>, s. <i>alveolaris</i> (alveolar colloid).</p>

<p>It was originally regarded as a tumour; its animal nature was first
established by Zeller and R. Virchow. The parasite, which varies
in size from that of a fist to a childâs head, presents a collection of
numerous cysts, measuring between 0Â·1 and 3 to 4&nbsp;mm. to 5&nbsp;mm.
in diameter, which are embedded at first in a soft, connective tissue
stroma; the cut surface has therefore a honeycomb appearance. The
cysts are surrounded by a pellucid and laminated cuticle, and each
according to its size encloses either a small-celled tissue or a cavity
lined by a parenchymatous layer; the fluid contained in such a cavity
may be transparent, or is rendered opaque by globules of fat, bile-pigment,
hÃ¦matoidin and fat crystals. According to some authors
all or most of these cysts intercommunicate; others state that this is
the case at least as regards the cuticle. The scolices are by no means<span class="pagenum" title="357"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a></span>
found in all the cysts, and when present only a few, rarely half, of the
cysts contain scolices (one or more); it is supposed that at least some
of these scolices are formed in brood capsules, and that the former
are capable of undergoing a cystic metamorphosis.</p>

<p>One circumstance is peculiar to the multilocular echinococcus
of man, namely, the disintegration that sets in at certain stages; in
the centre of the parasite a cavity forms that frequently becomes very
large and is filled with a purulent or brownish or brownish-green
viscid fluid; in this fluid one finds shreds of the wall of the cavity,
calcareous bodies, echinococcus cysts, also scolices and hooklets, as
well as fat globules and crystals of hÃ¦matoidin, margarine and
cholesterin and concretions of lime. Such ulcerative processes,
according to Ostertag, are never present in the multilocular echinococcus
of oxen,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> in which the separate cysts are larger and the
connective tissue integument less powerfully developed.</p>

</div>

<p>Hardly anything positive is known with regard to the development
of the alveolar echinococcus; its peculiar conformation is attributed
by some to enormous infection of oncospheres, by others to the
abnormal situation of one oncosphere; a few authors ascribe it to
infection of lymphatic vessels, others to infection of the biliary ducts
or to peculiarities of the surrounding hepatic tissue; Leuckart ascribes
it to a grape-like variety of form which continues budding; a few
more recent authors consider multilocular echinococcus to be specifically
different from unilocular echinococcus, and therefore also
different the species of TÃ¦nia arising from them. Melnikow-Raswedenkow
is also of this opinion. According to this author the
oncospheres infect the lumen of a branch of the portal vein in<span class="pagenum" title="358"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a></span>
Glissonâs capsule of the liver and grow into an irregularly shaped
formation (chitinous coil), which breaks through the vascular walls
and thus forms the alveoli. So far the data coincide well with
Leuckartâs opinion of the original grape-like form of the <i>Echinococcus
multilocularis</i>; according to Melnikow-Raswedenkow the âgranular
protoplasmic substanceâ (parenchymatous layer) is not only present
in the interior of the loculi but also outside, and, moreover, âovoid
embryosâ are supposed to develop in the chitinous coils, which,
âthanks to their amÅboid movements, reach the lumen of a vessel,
where, under favourable circumstances, they begin to develop
further,â that is to say, they become âchitinous cysts with fantastic
outlines,â or also âsingle-chambered chitinous cystsâ; scolices may
develop in both. DÃ©vÃ©, however, considers that these embryos are
only prolongations of the protoplasmic layer which secondarily
cuticularize.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The multilocular echinococcus, which in man produces a severe disease and
almost always leads to premature death, infects most frequently the liver, but may
also be found primarily in the brain, the spleen and the suprarenal capsule; from
the liver by means of metastasis it may reach the most various organs, especially
those of the abdomen, but also the lungs, the heart, etc. Up to 1902, 235 cases have
been described and up to 1906, 265, being 70 from Russia, 56 from Bavaria, 32 from
Switzerland, 30 from the Austrian Alps, 25 from WÃ¼rtemberg; the remaining cases
are distributed over Central Germany, Baden, Alsace, France, Upper Italy, North
America. In some the origin is doubtful; in any case after Russia, the mountainous
South of Europe is the principal region of distribution. As to the domesticated
animals, the same parasite is found principally in the ox (according to Meyer, in
Leipzig, in 7 per cent. of the oxen affected with echinococcus); it is rarer in the
sheep and very scarce in the pig.</p></div>

<p>It has already been mentioned above that recently the multilocular
echinococcus has been stated to be specifically different from hydatid
or unilocular echinococcus. To this may be added the fact that
Mangold, who fed a young pig with oncospheres of a TÃ¦nia reared
from the multilocular echinococcus, found two growths in the liver
four months later, which he took to be <i>E. multilocularis</i>, and consequently
one has to assume the existence of two different worms.
The chief defender of this view, already put forward by Vogler,
Mangold, and MÃ¼ller, is Possett. He bases his opinions on (1) the
more restricted distribution of the multilocular hydatid, the former
occurring in districts where only cattle are raised, the latter where
sheep-breeding is established; (2) that those engaged in looking after
sheep are attacked by multilocular, whereas those looking after cattle
are attacked by unilocular hydatid; (3) that among the cases of
unilocular hydatid occurring in the distribution areas of multilocular
hydatid no transitions between the two forms are observed; (4) on
the difference in the hooks both in the hydatid as well as in the TÃ¦nia<span class="pagenum" title="359"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a></span>
stage; the hooks of <i>TÃ¦nia echinococcus</i> are plump, sharply curved,
and have a short posterior root process the length of which is to that
of the total length as 1 to 4Â·7, whereas on the contrary the hooks of the
alveolar echinococcus are more slender, slightly bent, and have a
long posterior root process (1 to 2Â·5); and (5) on the form of the
uterus, which in the alveolar TÃ¦nia has the form of a spherically
distended sac anteriorly.</p>

<h4>Class. <b>NEMATODA.</b></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nemathelminthes with an alimentary canal.</p>

<p>Nematodes are as a rule elongated round worms of a filiform or fusiform shape;
their length varies according to the species from about 1&nbsp;mm. to 40 to 80&nbsp;cm.
The outer surface of the body is smooth or annulated, and at certain points provided
with papillÃ¦, occasionally also with bristles and alar appendages. The anterior end
carrying the oral aperture is usually rather slender, occasionally quite thin; the
posterior end is pointed or rounded; the anus, as a rule, lies somewhat in front of
the posterior extremity. The sexes are almost always separate, and the male can
as a rule be easily distinguished from the female because the former is smaller and
more slender, its posterior extremity is often spiral or incurved, or carries an alar
appendage, whereas the female is larger and thicker, and its posterior extremity
is straight. In the male the genitalia open into the anus; the sexual orifice of the
female opens ventrally along the median line in the anterior half of the body, in the
middle, or a little further back. Both sexes, moreover, have an orifice, the excretory
pore, which is situated ventrally in the median line and about the level of the
Åsophageal nerve ring.</p>

<p>In large species, even with the naked eye, two lighter transparent bands&mdash;the
lateral lines&mdash;may be distinguished; they run along the sides of the body from the
anterior to the posterior end, while two other bands, the median lines, running
along the ventral and dorsal mid-lines, are less evident; in exceptional cases there
are also four sub-median lines. These bands or lines are inward projections of the
ectoderm, and in them lie the nerves and excretory vessels (fig.&nbsp;260).</p>

<p>Some Nematodes live free in fresh or salt water, in soil, mud or decaying
vegetable matter, others parasitically in the most various organs of animals,
frequently also in plants.</p></div>


<h5><span class="smcap">Anatomy of the Nematodes.</span></h5>

<p>All the Nematodes are covered by (1) a <span class="lowercase smcap">CUTICLE</span>, which in the
small species is thin and delicate, while in the larger species it is
thickened, and may consist of several layers of complicated structure.
Canalicular pores do not occur. According to general opinion,
which is confirmed by the history of development, the cuticle is a
product of (2) the <span class="lowercase smcap">EPITHELIUM</span> or ectoderm that had formerly existed
or is still found beneath it; in young specimens and small species it
is perceptible, but in older worms it frequently alters so considerably<span class="pagenum" title="361"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a></span>
that not only do the borders of the cells disappear,<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> but a fine fibrous
differentiation appears in their cytoplasm. The matrix or ectoderm
then has the appearance of an ectodermal syncytium permeated by
fibres and strewn with nuclei, so that it is hardly distinguishable from
the tissue of (3) the <span class="lowercase smcap">CUTIS</span>, which is always present, though developed
to a varying degree. Both layers, matrix and cutis, project internally
as ridges and form the lateral lines, while the less marked median
lines are produced apparently only by the ectoderm (fig.&nbsp;260).</p>

lumbricoides</i>, showing thick cuticle, and beneath it the

the middle, and to the right and left near it in the body
wall the lateral lines with excretory vessel and lateral
nerves; above and below in the centre the dorsal or
ventral median lines with the nerves radiating to the
muscles, also the muscle cells with their striated outer
contractile portion and inner nucleated vesicular protoplasmic
portion. About 50/1. (After Brandes.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Unicellular cutaneous glands are known in parasitic as well as in
free-living species; they vary in number and arrangement, and are
found discharging some at the anterior extremity and others in the
vicinity of the genital orifices. In other cases large numbers of them
are present along the lateral lines; they are strongly developed in
most of the <i>TrichotrachelidÃ¦</i>, where they discharge either along a
part of the ventral surface or along the lateral and median lines; they
are placed so closely together that the ridges of the cuticle perforated
by the orifices have long been known, and have been described, as
ârodlet borders,â or âfields of rods.â</p>

<p>As the cutis is immediately adjacent to (4) the <span class="lowercase smcap">DERMO-MUSCULAR
TUBE</span> the simple layer of the muscular cells is divided into four quadrants
by the longitudinal lines&mdash;two dorsal and two ventral (fig.&nbsp;260).
The <span class="lowercase smcap">MUSCLES</span> are in the simplest cases large rhomboid cells that lie
two by two in each quadrant, so that on transverse section of the
entire worm only eight cells are perceptible. The outer border of
the cells is converted into contractile fibrils, while the contiguous
inner portion has remained protoplasmic, and contains the nucleus.
In large species the muscular cells do not only increase in length
(up to 3&nbsp;mm.) and in number in every quadrant, but their contractile
portion curves up to form a groove (like that of a dead leaf) thereby
even becoming thicker; simultaneously space is gained for more
cells, the protoplasmic parts of these cells (on transverse section) project
out of the grooves like vesicles. In all cases there is only one
layer of longitudinal muscular cells, which, by contracting, can shorten
the body or, by contracting one side, can bend it. In the latter case
the muscles of the opposite side have an antagonistic effect, or when
all the muscles are contracted, the elasticity of the cuticle acts in the
same way. Special muscles exist at the beginning of the gut and at
sections of the genital apparatus.</p>

<p>The existence of a cavity between the body and the gut wall has
hitherto been generally assumed, and has been referred to the cleavage
cavity, and consequently designated as a primary body cavity. More<span class="pagenum" title="362"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a></span>
recent investigators, however, state that such a cavity does not exist,
but that the space between the longitudinal muscles or their protoplasmic
portions and the gut epithelium is filled by a complicated
âisolation tissue.â This in the main proceeds from a large cell (<i>Is.</i>,
fig.&nbsp;262) which lies directly behind the nerve ring dorsal to the
Åsophagus, and consists of a system of lamellÃ¦ which sheathe the
muscles and penetrate through them to the cutis and also cover the
gut in a thin layer.</p>

</div>

<p>We may now consider the âtuft-likeâ or âphagocyticâ organs,
which attain 1&nbsp;cm. in size, and consist of four, six, or even more
ramified cells, which lie close to the walls of the body (fig.&nbsp;261).
They are found either only in the anterior part of the body (Ascaris),
or throughout the whole length of the body (Strongylus, syn., Sclerostomum),
and their position usually corresponds to the lateral lines.
In some species there are small protoplasmic cells on the processes
of these organs. In consequence of their size they can be recognized
with the naked eye, especially when they are loaded with granules of
stain (carmine, Indian ink) injected into the body cavity.</p>

cuticle, and which in some species is provided with âteeth,â representing
differentiated portions of the cuticle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Åsophagus</span> (fig. 262), which arises from the base of the oral
cavity, is as a rule a short, bottle-shaped tube with triradiate lumen;
its wall is chiefly composed of radiating muscular fibres, which give
it the appearance of being transversely striped when viewed from the
surface. There exist also in its wall three large gland cells (Åsophageal
glands) and nerves arising from the lateral lines and running
forward. The radial fibres cause a dilatation of the lumen, and
exercise an effect antagonistic to the elasticity of the cuticle lining
the inner surface. The latter has its own particular layer, which is
not in direct connection with that of the oral cavity. Special dilator
muscles, arising from the dermo-muscular tube and situated at the
commencement of the Åsophagus, are only known in a few species.
The posterior end of the Åsophagus presents a bulb-like dilatation,
and is frequently provided with small chitinous movable valves. In
a few forms, which belong to the <i>TrichotrachelidÃ¦</i> (Trichocephalus,
Trichinella), the Åsophagus is a very long cuticular tube, beset on its
dorsal surface with a series of large nucleated cells. In others (Cucullanus,
Ascaris, etc.), a tube, the so-called glandular stomach, lined
only by epithelial cells, follows behind the muscular Åsophagus.
This glandular stomach is, from its structure, easily distinguished
from the mid-gut, or chyle intestine, which is likewise cellular. The
so-called mid-gut is a tube lined by flat, cubical, or cylindrical cells
(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_260">260</a>) surrounded by âisolation tissueâ; its transverse section is
circular or flattened dorso-ventrally; the lumen may run in a straight
line, or it runs a sinuous course through the alternating prominences
of the then flat epithelial cells.</p>

<p>The ectodermal hind gut is, as a rule, very short. At the anal
opening the cuticle and the subcuticular layers are reflected inwards,
forming the lining of the hind gut. In large species the subcuticular
tissue forms large cells on which anteriorly lie in addition large
âglandular cells.â<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> In the male the ejaculatory duct opens at this
point. Around the end part of the gut, either on the chyle intestine
or at the beginning of the end gut, there exists a sphincter muscle
arising from a muscle cell which acts antagonistically to the two
diaphragm-like dilator muscle cells which stretch from the gut to the<span class="pagenum" title="364"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a></span>
body wall. In many species large stretches of the gut are provided
with dilator muscles. There is sometimes a retrogressive absorption
of the gut in the adult stage of a few parasitic species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Intestinal cÃ¦ca</span> and <span class="smcap">Åsophageal glands</span> sometimes exist as
intestinal appendages;
the former are tubular
appendages of various
size, running backwards
or forwards, and arising
from the posterior
extremity of the Åsophagus.
They are lacking
in many species.
The Åsophageal glands
are unicellular; a dorsal
and two subventral
glands may be distinguished
according to
their position; as a rule
they open into the
Åsophagus at a distance
from one another. The
body of the gland lies
in the bulb of the Åsophagus,
or in the dorsal
<i>cul-de-sac</i> arising
from it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The nervous system</span> is sufficiently known in a few species only;
it consists of a ring containing fifty to sixty fibres closely surrounding
the Åsophagus, various groups of ganglion cells, and a certain
number of nerves extending anteriorly as well as posteriorly. The
remarkably small number of fibres, as well as ganglion cells, is
characteristic of the nervous system of all Nematodes. Immediately
behind the Åsophageal ring (fig.&nbsp;263, <i>Lg.</i>) an agglomeration of ganglion
cells lies at either side (lateral ganglia); part of their off-shoots
form the Åsophageal ring, and part are directed posteriorly and
ventrally, and unite partly in front of and partly at the back of the
excretory pore, with fibres originating direct from the Åsophageal
ring, and passing along the ventral median line to the back; these
fibres then together form the ventral median nerve (fig.&nbsp;263, <i>V.m.n.</i>).
This nerve, originally consisting of thirty to fifty fibres, becomes
in the female attenuated quite evenly in its further course. There is
also an agglomeration of ganglion cells close in front of the anus (anal
ganglia), and then the median nerve divides in order to combine with<span class="pagenum" title="365"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a></span>
the lateral nerves on either side. In the male the median nerve
enlarges to nearly the original number of fibres in front of the anal
ganglion, which contains seven
cells; there is also an anal ring
embracing the terminal gut, and
there are two ganglion cells in it on
each side. In the dorsal median
line the dorsal median nerve is alike
in both sexes; arising in front with
a single root from the Åsophageal
ring, it gathers its fibres from the
lateral ganglia; in the anterior part
of the body it consists of thirteen
to twenty fibres; in the posterior
part of the body the fibres are reduced
to four or six; behind the
anus it divides and combines with
the lateral nerves; the latter
consists of two fascicles at either
side right up to their most posterior
extent&mdash;one dorsal and one
ventral&mdash;which in the greater part
of the body do not run in, but
beside the lateral lines, and exhibit
a different origin anteriorly. The
ventral fascicle at each side branches
off from the ventral median nerve
in front of the excretory pore,
whereas the dorsal fascicles originate
from the Åsophageal ring close
to the lateral ganglia. Each of the
four fascicles contains only two or
three fibres, which run backwards
parallel to the lateral lines; a few
centimetres in front of the caudal
extremity they enter the lateral
lines and remain separate from one
another up to the level of the anal
ganglion; here they amalgamate on
either side, after each interpolating
one ganglion cell, with the single
short lateral nerve which first takes
up the forked ends of the ventral and then of the dorsal median nerve;
finally, both lateral nerves unite with each other at the back in an
arch-like manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="366"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a></span></p>

<p>In the male each ventral part of the lateral nerves becomes
thickened by taking up fibres from the ventral nerves, which become
thickened posteriorly to the nervus bursalis, which towards the
middle gives off a mass of fibres to the âgenital papillÃ¦â situated
in front of and behind the anus; the number of these fibres averages
eighty to 100; in its further course the bursal nerve resembles the
corresponding ventral part of the lateral nerves of the female.</p>

<p>The ventral and dorsal nerves are connected by a number of
semicircular commissures, which originate from the ventral nerves
and serve to supply the dorsal nerve, which is always being
decreased by fibres departing from it. It is remarkable that these
commissures are not placed symmetrically, and their position also
is different in the two sexes; in the female there are thirty-one on
the right side and only thirteen on the left side. In the male there
are thirty-three commissures on the right side and fourteen on the
left, which run into the subcuticular layer, generally in pairs, and
usually cross at the level of the lateral lines.</p>

<p>The fibres of the two median nerves are chiefly motor; fascicular
processes run from each protoplasmic part of the muscular cells to
the median nerves; from these they take up bundles of primitive
fibrils, which separate, pass through the protoplasmic part and enter
the contractile part (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_260">260</a>). One part of the fibrils, however,
penetrates beyond the muscles into the subcuticular layer, where
they form a network, probably of a sensory nature, with contiguous
fibrils. Nerves directed anteriorly finally originate from the
Åsophageal ring; they consist each of three fibres, carry three
ganglion cells at their point of origin, and enter the sensory organs
of the three papillÃ¦ surrounding the oral aperture. Two of these
little trunks lie in the lateral lines, the remaining four are situated
in the middle of the four quadrants (Nn. sub-mediani anteriores).</p>

<p>Parasitic species lack higher <span class="lowercase smcap">ORGANS OF SENSE</span>; free-living worms
occasionally have two rust-red eyes, sometimes with lenses, at the
anterior part of the body. In addition to the above-mentioned
sensory papillÃ¦ surrounding the oral aperture and the genital papillÃ¦
of the male at the end of the body, another pair exist in the vicinity
of the lateral ganglia, the âcervical papillÃ¦,â and two dorsal papillÃ¦
in the central region of the body and two lateral ones near the tip of
the tail (<i>AscaridÃ¦</i>). The differences in the distribution and number
of the sensory papillÃ¦ serve for characterizing the larger and smaller
groups of Nematodes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The excretory organs</span> of the Nematodes are variable. In a
great many cases the apparatus is symmetrical, and consists of a vessel
commencing in the posterior extremity in each lateral line (fig.&nbsp;260),
and passing anteriorly. In the vicinity of the anterior extremity both<span class="pagenum" title="367"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a></span>
tubes pass out of the lateral lines, bend ventrally, and, in the median
ventral line, unite into a short vesicle formed by an ectodermal cell&mdash;the
cavity of which is lined by a continuation of the cuticle of the
body&mdash;which opens into the excretory pore (fig.&nbsp;263, <i>Exp.</i>). Asymmetry
is occasioned through the excretory duct proceeding from the
ventral pore to the lateral line, and it here proceeds as (or takes up)
the left excretory canal, which anteriorly is a broader tube and runs
along the left lateral line; shortly before its union with the excretory
duct it throws out a branch to the right towards the lateral line,
which, however, always remains weak, and runs posteriorly in the
right lateral line; a few smaller branches in addition spring from
the left main stem. In other species the right branch is completely
suppressed; the entire organ thus lies in the left lateral line, and
consists of the excretory duct, which occasionally opens quite in front
near the lips, as well as the excretory canal, which throws out a
number of lateral branches.</p>

<p>This excretory vesicle is a single elongated or horse-shoe-shaped
cell, with a large nucleus and an intracellular tubular system, which is
connected with the excretory duct arising from the excretory pore on
the outer surface (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_326">326</a>). The so-called ventral gland is the only excretory
organ of marine Nematodes, and probably represents a primitive
form. Goldschmidt, who has investigated the excretory apparatus
of <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>, considers that the vessels running in the lateral
lines are only ducts to which belong a glandular system hitherto
overlooked or otherwise interpreted. This system also lies in the
lateral lines, and takes the form of two glandular tracts, forming
a syncytial tissue in which lie the ducts, one dorsal, one ventral.
In parts these tracts are connected by commissures, although their
junction with the excretory vessels cannot be clearly made out. These
statements, however, require confirmation. The author has further
found that the anterior ends of the lateral canals, directly before they
bend ventrally, anastomose with one another and give off anteriorly
a small blind process, which can be interpreted as a rudiment
of a canal coming from the head end, and as a matter of fact,
according to Golowin, such anterior excretory canals exist in a
number of genera.</p>

<p>In a number of Nematodes (Cheiracanthus, Capillaria, Trichocephalus,
Trichinella, etc.), however, special excretory organs are
lacking; possibly the cutaneous glands, which are in these species
generally powerfully developed, replace these organs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sexual organs.</span>&mdash;With the exception of a few species, the
Nematodes are sexually differentiated.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Female Sexual Organs.</i>&mdash;The sexual orifice (vulva), surrounded
by thick labia, is, as a rule, ventral and varies in position from near the<span class="pagenum" title="368"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a></span>
head to near the anus. It leads into a short or long vagina (ectodermic),
bifurcating into the two uteri, which may be long or short; the long
filiform ovaries are continuations of them (fig.&nbsp;264). Further there is
often, <i>e.g.</i>, in Ankylostoma, a differentiation into the following parts:
(1) <i>Ovejector</i>: the specialized portion of the uterus before it joins the
vagina; there may be a separate one for each uterus, or a common
one for both uteri. (2) <i>Seminal receptacle</i>: at the other extremity of
the uterus. (3) <i>Oviduct</i>: a narrow tube connecting the ovary with<span class="pagenum" title="369"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a></span>
the uterus proper. (For the explanation of the terms <i>convergent</i> and
<i>divergent</i> uteri <i>vide</i> footnote p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_432">432</a>.) Uterus and ovaries, which arise
in the first place from a single cell, lie between the body wall and the
gut and are surrounded by connective tissue. In some species (for
instance, Trichinella) the ovary is single.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the blind end of the ovary there is a mass of protoplasm with numerous nuclei
that multiply continuously. Gradually the nuclei arrange themselves in longitudinal
rows (fig.&nbsp;265) and the protoplasm commences to leave the periphery and surround
each nucleus. The nearer to the uterus the more progressive is this loosening
process, until club-shaped cells each containing a nucleus are developed. The most
pointed end of each, however, is still attached to an axial fibre of protoplasm, the
<i>rhachis</i>; probably this has some connection with the nutrition of the ova. Finally
the ova fall off and reach the uterus, where they are fertilized and enclosed in shells.</p></div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Male Sexual Organs.</i>&mdash;There is never more than one testis
(fig.&nbsp;266), which is a straight or sinuous tube of the same construction
as an ovary, and in which the mother cells originate in the same
manner as the ova. In the same way as the ovary passes into the
uterus, so does the testis pass into the spermatic duct; the latter is
often divided into the somewhat dilated seminal vesicle and into
the muscular ductus ejaculatorius, which, running ventral to the
intestine backward (fig.&nbsp;267), finally opens into the cloaca. In
many species, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>A. duodenale</i>, the ejaculatory duct is surrounded for
a greater or less portion of its extent by the cement gland, the secretion
of which (brownish or blackish in colour) serves for copulation. The
ejaculatory duct of the large <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> is for the most of its course
surrounded by a muscular network which takes its origin from the
two dilator cells of the gut (fig.&nbsp;268
<i>F</i>.). The spermatozoa of the
Nematodes, it may be noted, only
attain their full development after
the sperm mother cells have been
conveyed by copulation into the
uteri of the female genitalia. In
their form (sheathless, capable of
amÅboid motion) they differ from
those of most other animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spicules.</span>&mdash;The male genital apparatus is also provided with one
or two sacs, situated on the dorsal side of the intestine, and opening
into the cloaca. In each sac there is a chitinous rod-like body, the
spicule. Further, in many cases there exists, more or less fixed in the
dorsal wall of the cloaca, a chitinous structure, the accessory piece or
<i>gubernaculum</i>, the latter name implying its function of guiding the
spicules during copulation (fig.&nbsp;264<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>). A special muscular apparatus,<span class="pagenum" title="370"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a></span>
consisting of protractors and retractors, moves the spicules. The
protractors or exsertors in the large AscaridÃ¦ consist of four flat
band-like muscles which surround the spicule sac. Two long muscle
cells which arise proportionally far forward on the dorsal side of the
lateral line and are inserted into the base of the spicules serve as
retractors. The spicules can be projected
from the cloacal orifice (anus) during copulation,
and when they are introduced into
the vagina they serve as prehensile organs,
perhaps also as stimulatory organs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bursa copulatrix.</span>&mdash;The males in many genera possess epidermal
wing-like appendages at their posterior extremity. These are supported

bursÃ¦, <i>e.g.</i>, in the <i>StrongylidÃ¦</i>, the ribs are called rays, as they consist
not only of nerve fibres but mainly of âpulp,â <i>i.e.</i>, prolongations of
the subcuticular layer. BursÃ¦ are either open, <i>i.e.</i>, bilaterally
symmetrical, or closed, when the posterior border is continuous all
round. A <i>pseudo-bursa</i> is one unsupported by ribs or rays, <i>e.g.</i>, in
Trichuris. The bursa serves as an organ of prehension during
copulation. Some forms, moreover, carry a sucker at the posterior
extremity (<i>e.g.</i>, Heterakis); in others the spicules and other prehensile
organs are absent; they are then replaced by an evertible
cloaca, <i>e.g.</i>, Trichinella.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Development of the Nematodes.</span></h5>

<p>After impregnation, the ovum develops around itself a delicate
membrane (vitelline membrane), and subsequently an egg-shell is
formed. This is derived either as a secretion from the uterine wall
or it is a further differentiation of the vitelline membrane, the original
single membrane splitting into two, the outer becoming the egg-shell.
Further the uterus often secretes a special albuminous covering
around the egg-shell. The âyolkâ granules of the ovum are secretions
of the protoplasm of the ovum itself and first appear when the
rhachis is formed. In certain cases ova lie in follicles or capsules
formed of epithelium cells derived from the ovarian tubes. These
cells subsequently fuse and form a membrane&mdash;the <span class="lowercase smcap">CHORION</span>.</p>

<p>The shape of the completed eggs is characteristic of the different
species, and therefore a single egg often suffices to diagnose the
species. According to the species, the eggs may be deposited sooner
or later, either before or during segmentation, or with the embryo
perfectly developed. Only a few species are viviparous, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Dracunculus
mediensis</i>, <i>Trichinella spiralis</i>; in the other Nematodes the
further development of the extruded eggs takes place after various<span class="pagenum" title="372"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a></span>
lengths of time in the open, in moist earth, or in water. Thick-shelled
eggs can maintain their developmental capacity for a long time, even
after prolonged desiccation.</p>

<p>Finally, a nematode-like embryo develops, which usually lies
somewhat coiled up within the shell, and varies in its further
development according to the species to which it belongs.</p>

<p>In the simplest forms, as in the free-living Nematodes, the
embryos, apart from their size, resemble their parents, and grow up
into these after leaving the egg-shell. In many parasitical Nematodes,
however, the young must be called <i>larvÃ¦</i>, as they present
characters which are subsequently lost.</p>

<p>The manner of conveyance of the eggs or the embryos contained
in them after they have left the body into the definite host is very
different in the various species.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Without Intermediate Host.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) In many the conveyance into
the definite host is effected directly after the larvÃ¦ have developed
within the eggs; thus, for instance, the feeding of suitable animals
with the embryo-containing eggs of species of Trichocephalus and
Ascaris leads to an infection of the gut, for the young Trichocephali
or Ascarides only leave the egg-shell when they have attained the
intestine of the final host, in which they become adult.</p>

<p>In other cases (<i>b</i>) Ancylostoma, Necator, the larvÃ¦ hatch in the
open, and live for a time free, changing their form; they grow, cast
their skin, and finally gain the intestine of the host by means of water
or through the skin, when they lose their larval characters and
assume the structure of the adult worm.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) In a number of Nematodes, however, <span class="lowercase smcap">HETEROGONY</span> occurs.
This terms signifies a mode of development in which two structurally
different sexual generations of the same species alternate with each
other. To these appertains, for instance, <i>Angiostomum</i> (syn.:
<i>Rhabdonema</i>) <i>nigrovenosum</i>, which lives in the lungs of frogs and
toads; this Nematode measures about 1&nbsp;cm. in length and is
hermaphrodite (protandric). The eggs are deposited in the pulmonary
cavity, and through the cilia of the same reach the oral cavity, where
they are swallowed and thus conveyed into the intestine. They pass
through the entire gut, and are finally evacuated with the fÃ¦ces; often,
indeed, the young themselves emerge from the egg-shell within the
hind-gut of the frogs. These young forms become sexually differentiated,
remain much smaller than the parent, their Åsophagus is
differently constructed (rhabditis form), and they are non-parasitic
(fig.&nbsp;266). After having grown in the open they copulate; the males
die soon after copulation, and the females in their own bodies develop
a few young, which, given the opportunity to get into frogs, infect
them, and are transformed into the hermaphroditic Angiostomum.<span class="pagenum" title="373"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a></span>
The same manner of development occurs in other species of the same
genus, and also in the case of <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i>.</p>

<p>(2) <i>With Intermediate Host.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
Frequently, however, the
larvÃ¦ of Nematodes make use
of one or even two intermediate
hosts; their condition then
resembles that of Cestodes or
Trematodes, excepting that
there is never a multiplication
within the intermediate hosts.
The larvÃ¦ become encapsuled
amongst the tissues of the intermediate
host, and wait till
they are introduced with the
latter into the final host. For
instance, <i>Ollulanus tricuspis</i>, the
adult form of which is found in
cats, previously lives encysted
in the muscular system of mice.
<i>Cucullanus elegans</i>, which attains
the adult stage in fishes
(perch, etc.), is found encysted
in species of Cyclops. Other
examples of species that require an intermediate host are <i>Filaria
bancrofti</i> and <i>Dracunculus medinensis</i>.</p>

<p>Peculiar conditions prevail in the case of (<i>b</i>) <i>Trichinella spiralis</i>.
This species, which in its adult state lives in the intestine of man and
of various mammals, is viviparous; the young TrichinÃ¦, however, do
not leave the intestine, but reach the intestinal wall (Cerfontaine,
Askanazy) in the following way: the female intestinal TrichinÃ¦ bore
into the intestinal wall, where they are found in the submucosa, or
in the lumen of the dilated lacteal vessels. Here the young are born,
in the intestinal wall, and leave this position with the lymph stream.
Some of them, no doubt, actively bore through the intestinal wall,
reaching the lymph or blood-stream, or even pass into the body
cavity. What occurs during their further migrations is difficult to
say at present. It has hitherto been maintained that the wandering
is entirely active; for instance, the ligaturing of an artery would be
no protection against the part of the body supplied by such artery
being invaded by Trichinella. This observation cannot be otherwise
explained than by the active progress of the young Trichinella. The
question, however, may be mooted as to where and when the worms
quit the blood-vessels, which they for the most part reach through<span class="pagenum" title="374"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a></span>
the thoracic duct, the natural connection between the vascular system
and the lymphatic system, to wander further independently, and
ultimately reach the muscular system, in which they become encysted
(fig.&nbsp;269). Thus the progeny does not leave the body of the host
inhabited by the parents, as is generally the case amongst helminthes,
but uses it as an intermediate carrier to reach another host, which
is then the final host. The latter may belong to another species,
or may be another individual of the same species. This second
migration is, of course, purely passive.</p>


<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Classification of the Nematoda.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Nematodes are usually divided into a number of families, some of which
it is at present impossible to define accurately; moreover, the definition of many
genera is also in an unsatisfactory state.</p></div>


<p class="spec">Family. <b>AnguillulidÃ¦</b>, Gervais and van Beneden, 1859.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A âfamilyâ name not definable. They comprise a vast number of small forms,
most of which live free in fresh water, in soil, or in macerating substances; amongst
them there are some which live parasitically on plants, more rarely on animals.
They do not exceed 8&nbsp;mm. in length. The large majority are only 1 to 2&nbsp;mm., or
even 0Â·5&nbsp;mm. The uterus is straight. Eggs in the uterus at one time, one to
four. Genera very numerous, but many of them insufficiently defined (Anguillula,

The posterior extremity of the body of the male has a heart-shaped

be lacking. The spicules measure 0Â·027 to 0Â·033&nbsp;mm. in length, but
are never quite alike. The posterior extremity of the female is long
and pointed; the vulva lies somewhat behind the middle of the body,
the ovary is single, the eggs are oval, 60&nbsp;Âµ by 35&nbsp;Âµ.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This species was found in Stuhlweissenburg by Scheiber in the acid urine
(containing albumin, pus and blood) of a woman suffering from pyelonephritis,
pneumonia and acute intestinal catarrh; the observer was able to convince himself
that the Nematodes which were found during the whole period of the illness lived
in the vagina, and were evacuated with the urine.</p></div>

<p>Oerley proved that this species had long been known; during
its larval stage (<i>Anguillula mucronata</i>, Grube, 1849) it lives in earthworms;
in its adult stage it lives in decomposing matter in the soil.
By introducing individuals of this species into the vagina of mice,
Oerley succeeded in obtaining infection and multiplication (facultative
parasitism). These Nematodes must in some such way have got into
the vagina of Scheiberâs patient.</p>

<p>Two other cases described by Baginsky and Peiper probably
belonged to the same or a nearly related species.</p>

<p class="spec"><b>Rhabditis niellyi</b>, Blanchard, 1885.</p>

<p class="syn">Syn.: <i>Leptodera niellyi</i>, Blanchard, 1885.</p>

<p>In 1882 Nielly had a cabin-boy, aged 14, under observation
in Brest. The lad had never left the neighbourhood of Brest,
and had suffered from itching papules on the skin for five or
six weeks; in the papules the observer found one or several rhabdites,
measuring 0Â·33&nbsp;mm. in length by 0Â·30&nbsp;mm. in breadth.
Their cuticle presented a delicate transverse striation; the intestine
was the only internal organ recognizable, and it opened somewhat
in front of the posterior extremity. Therefore, it must have belonged
to the rhabditis-like larva of a Nematode, the adult stage of which
is unknown.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The manner of infection was established almost certainly by a further observation
of Niellyâs: at the commencement of the illness small Nematodes were
found in the blood of the patient; later on, however, they disappeared, neither were
Nematodes found in the fÃ¦ces, urine or sputum. Therefore it must be concluded
that the cabin-boy, who was in the habit of drinking water from brooks, had thus
ingested embryo-containing eggs of a Nematode; the young hatched out in the
intestine, perforated it, reached the blood and then settled in the skin; but, on the
other hand, the entry may have been direct through the skin.</p>

<p>In connection with the foregoing, reference should be made to a communication
by Whittles, insufficient from a zoological point of view. In a case of hypertrophic
gingivitis occurring in a female patient, aged 19, who had never left Birmingham,
he found Nematode larvÃ¦ in the periosteum of the upper jaw, which was excised
after extraction of the right premolar; the genital rudiment could be recognized in
them. Similar larvÃ¦ were found in the same patient in abscesses in various regions
of the skin, and in the case of her mother in the blood. The author considers that
the infection took place through a dog, and refers to the case of OâNeil (1875), who
found FilariÃ¦ in the skin (in the condition known as âcraw-crawâ), referred by
Manson to <i>Filaria perstans</i>. OâNeilâs case was quoted, and attributed to <i>Filaria
sanguinis hominis</i>. In conclusion, the author states that he has repeatedly found
Nematode larvÃ¦ in the blood of persons who suffered from pruritus; in his opinion
the parasite had been imported through the agency of troops returned from South
Africa. Glatzel found true Filaria larvÃ¦ in a pustule of a cutaneous eruption of the
trunk and extremities in a patient at Dar-es-Salam.</p>

<p>Skin diseases which are caused by young Nematodes are also observed in dogs
(Siedamgrotzky, MÃ¶ller, J.&nbsp;G. Schneider, KÃ¼nnemann), foxes (Leuckart), and horses
(Semmer). ZÃ¼rn found young Nematodes (<i>AnguillulidÃ¦</i>) also in pigâs flesh. In
KÃ¼nnemannâs case it was shown that the adult Rhabdites lived in the straw upon
which the dog lay.</p></div>

assumed that the patient, who was hysterical and suffered from chronic nephritis,
employed vaginal douches with diluted vinegar, perhaps to deceive her physician or
to protect herself against conception. According to Ward, Billings and Miller are
said to have reported on two other cases. Ill-effects which might be connected with
the vinegar eel (<i>Anguillula aceti</i>) were not present.</p></div>

<p>In 1876, a number of French
soldiers returned to Toulon from
Cochin China suffering from
severe diarrhÅa. Dr. Normand,
under whose treatment they
were, discovered a large number
of Nematodes in the evacuated
fÃ¦ces, and Bavay described
them as <i>Anguillula stercoralis</i>. Soon after Normand, at the <i>post-mortem</i> of five
patients who had died of Cochin China diarrhÅa, found numerous other
Nematodes in the intestine, from the stomach to the rectum, in the bile-ducts and
in the pancreas, and these he handed over to Bavay. The latter diagnosed another<span class="pagenum" title="381"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a></span>
species, and described them as <i>A. intestinalis</i>. Both forms were then regarded
as the cause of Cochin China diarrhÅa until, in 1882, Leuckart was able to
demonstrate that the two forms are only two succeeding generations of the same
species, of which the one (<i>A. intestinalis</i>) lives parasitically in the intestine,
whereas its young (<i>A. stercoralis</i>) attain the open, where they come to maturity
and propagate. The young of these again live parasitically. There thus exists
the same heterogony as was discovered by Leuckart in <i>Angiostomum nigrovenosum</i>
of frogs, which heterogony, indeed, according to v. Linstow, appertains
to the entire family of the <i>AngiostomidÃ¦</i>.</p></div>

<p>(1) The parasitic generation (strongyloid or filariform â) is quite
colourless and cannot be seen <i>in situ</i> even with a lens. To detect
them it is necessary to scrape the mucosa of the jejunum and examine
the scrapings microscopically. It measures 2Â·2&nbsp;mm. in length, and
34&nbsp;Âµ to 70&nbsp;Âµ in breadth; the cuticle is finely transversely striated;
the mouth is surrounded by four lips; the Åsophagus is almost cylindrical
and a third the length of the entire body. The anus opens
shortly in front of the pointed posterior extremity; the vulva is
situated at junction of middle and posterior thirds of the body; the
uterus has no special ovejector; the eggs measure 50&nbsp;Âµ to 58&nbsp;Âµ in
length, and 30&nbsp;Âµ to 34&nbsp;Âµ in breadth, and lie in a chain one behind
the other (fig.&nbsp;270). As in the case of <i>Angiostomum nigrovenosum</i>,
Leuckart considers this stage to be hermaphroditic, the testes
degenerating after having functioned; other authors (Rovelli) regard
it as a female reproducing by parthenogenesis.</p>

<p>(2) The free-living generation (â and â) has a smooth body,
cylindrical, somewhat more slender at the anterior extremity and
pointed at the tail end. The mouth has four indistinct lips; the
Åsophagus is short with a double (rhabditis-like) bulb; there is a
<b>Y</b>-shaped valve in the posterior bulb; the anus opens in front of the
tail end. The males measure 0Â·7&nbsp;mm. in length, 0Â·035&nbsp;mm. in breadth.
Their posterior end is rolled up; the two brown spicules are small
(38&nbsp;Âµ) and much curved. There is also a gubernaculum. The
females measure 1&nbsp;mm. in length or a little over; 0Â·05&nbsp;mm. in breadth.
The tail end is straight and pointed; the vulva lies somewhat behind
the middle of the body. The yellowish, thin-shelled ova measure
70&nbsp;Âµ in length and 45&nbsp;Âµ in breadth.</p>

<p>As Askanazy has shown, the parasitic form bores deeply into the
mucous membrane of the intestine, and frequently into the epithelium
of LieberkÃ¼hnâs glands, both for nourishment and oviposition. The
eggs then develop in the intestinal wall. The eggs which are found in
scrapings from the mucosa occur, at least in the case of Strongyloides
of the sheep, in chains enclosed in a thin tube or sheath, the origin
of which is doubtful; possibly it is the uterus. The eggs themselves
are only rarely found in stools, <i>e.g.</i>, after a strong purge. The
larvÃ¦, which are hatched out, and measure 0Â·2 to 0Â·25&nbsp;mm. long by<span class="pagenum" title="382"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a></span>
0Â·016&nbsp;mm. broad, again reach the lumen of the intestine,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> and grow to
double or three times that size, until they are passed out with the
fÃ¦ces. They already differ from the parent (â) in the shape (rhabditiform)
of the Åsophagus. When the external temperature is
sufficiently high (26Â° to
35Â°&nbsp;C.), they become
sexually mature after
moulting. In about
thirty hours they are completely
developed and
copulate, now forming
the free-living rhabditiform
generation. At
lower temperatures the
larvÃ¦ only moult, but
do not escape from the
old cuticle and do not
develop further. At a temperature of about 25Â°&nbsp;C. only some of the
larvÃ¦ attain maturity.</p>

<p>The females of the free-living
generation (rhabÂ­diÂ­tiÂ­form) deposit from
thirty to forty eggs, which develop
rapidly, someÂ­times even within the
uterus in the case of old females.
After the larvÃ¦ have emerged from the
egg-shell, they measure 0Â·22&nbsp;mm. in
length, and possess the characteristics
of the parents (rhabditiform larvÃ¦).
When they have grown to 0Â·55&nbsp;mm.
they moult, and while losing their
own characteristics they acquire the
characteristics of their parasitic grandparents
(strongyloid or filariform).
After about eight days the free-living
adult generation in the cultures have
disappeared, and all the rhabditiform
larvÃ¦ have been transformed into
strongyloid or filariform larvÃ¦; they
then die off unless they reach the
intestine.</p>

<p>This cycle of development holds
good for <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i> of
tropical origin (Bavay, Leuckart, LeichÂ­tenÂ­stern,
Zinn). In the European
StrongÂ­yloides the free-living generation,
as a rule, is absent (Grassi,
Sonsino, Leichtenstern, Braun); the
rhabditis-like larvÃ¦ evacuated with the
fÃ¦ces are transformed into the strongÂ­yloid
or filariÂ­form type of larva (in
cultures which are easily made) which
will only become adult if introduced
into man.</p>

<p>So that we have these two cycles:
(<i>A</i>) (1) â parasitic, (2) eggs, the rhabditiform
larvÃ¦ in fÃ¦ces, (3) free-living
strongyloid or filariform larva,
(4) â parasitic. (<i>B</i>) (1) (2) (3) as before,
then (4) adult â and â, free living,
(5) eggs, (6) rhabditiform larva,
(7) strongyloid or filariform larva,
(8) â parasitic.</p>

<p>Infection of man results not only<span class="pagenum" title="384"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a></span>
from direct entry into the stomach but also, according to van Durme
and Looss, through the skin.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Occurrence in Man.</i>&mdash;As already mentioned, <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i> was
first observed in persons suffering from so-called Cochin China diarrhÅa.
From the enormous numbers of parasites evacuated with the fÃ¦ces, the cause
of the disease was apparently evident. It appeared, however, that only some of
the soldiers returning from Cochin China and Martinique, and suffering from
diarrhÅa, harboured Strongyloides (Chauvin). Breton made the same observations
in Cochin China and found that only 10Â·4 per cent. of cases of chronic dysentery,
and 8Â·8 per cent. of chronic diarrhÅa, show Strongyloides. Normand, moreover,
found that only a few of the Europeans residing in Cochin China are exempt
from <i>S. intestinalis</i>, yet the people exhibit no intestinal symptoms; if, however,
from any cause a catarrhal condition of the intestine supervenes the condition
is changed, the parasites appear in larger numbers, and the disorder is
considerably intensified.</p>

<p><i>S. intestinalis</i>, besides being present in the Indo-China region, also occurs
in the Antilles, in Brazil, Africa, and Europe; in 1878 it was discovered
in Italy by Grassi and C. and E. Parona; in 1880 it was also found in the
labourers working at the St. Gothard tunnel. It was imported into Germany,
Belgium, and the Netherlands by Italian labourers. One sporadic case has been
observed in East Prussia, and the worm has also been reported from Siberia.</p>

<p>In mammals the following species are found: <i>Probstmayria</i> (<i>Strongyloides</i>)
<i>vivipara</i>, Ransom, 1907, in <i>Equus caballus</i>; <i>Strongyloides fÃ¼lleborni</i>, v. Linst., in
<i>Anthropopithecus troglodytes</i> and <i>Cynocephalus babuin</i>.</p>

<p>Their development is, so far as is known, the same as that of <i>Strongyloides
stercoralis</i> (v. Linstow, <i>Centralbl. f. Bakt., Path. u. Infektionsk.</i>, 1905, Orig. xxxviii,

Agatharchides (140 <span class="lowercase smcap">B.C.</span>). Galen called the disorder dracontiasis; the Arabian
authors were well acquainted with the worm. It is found not only in Medina or
Arabia, but also in Persia, Turkestan, Hindustan. The Guinea worm is also widely
distributed in Africa, on the coasts as well as in the interior. It occurs in the Fiji
Islands. It was carried to South America by negro slaves, but is said at the present
time to exist in only quite a few places (British Guiana, Brazil [Bahia]); it is also
observed in mammals (ox, horse, dog, leopard, jackal [<i>Canis lapuster</i>], etc.).</p></div>

<p><i>Dracunculus medinensis</i> in its adult stage lives in superficial ulcers
on the body surface; it is seen most frequently on the lower extremities,
more especially in the region of the ankle, but it also occurs in
other parts of the body&mdash;on the trunk, scrotum, perineum, on the
upper extremities, and in the eyelids and tongue. Sometimes there
is only one ulcer and one worm, but more commonly several. It
attacks man without distinction of race, age or sex. It is observed
most frequently during the months of June to August.</p>

<p><i>Life history.</i><a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a>&mdash;When about a year old the worm seeks the surface<span class="pagenum" title="387"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a></span><span class="pagenum hide" title="388"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a></span>
of the body and produces there a thickening as big as a florin. Over
this a vesicle forms which eventually ruptures, and at the bottom
of the ulcer can be seen a hole from which a part of the worm may
project. On bathing the sides of the ulcer with water, a drop of
fluid, at first clear then milky, exudes. This contains numerous larvÃ¦.
In other cases a thin tube an inch long is prolapsed (through the
vulva). This is probably the uterus, but the mechanism of parturition
is not clearly known. It lasts for about a fortnight. An abundant
supply of larvÃ¦ can be got by placing wet compresses on a <i>fresh</i>
ulcer. In a few hours a mass of larvÃ¦ is obtained.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ are 500&nbsp;Âµ to 750&nbsp;Âµ by 15&nbsp;Âµ to 25&nbsp;Âµ, with a long slender
tail about one-third of the total length. The cuticle is transversely
striated. The body is flattened. They possess an Åsophagus and
gut. At the anus there are apparently glandular structures.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ live
and move actively in
water for about two
days, the majority
dying on the third
(Leiper). If a number
of Cyclops sp.
have been collected
and isolated in clean
water, and the larvÃ¦
are now added, the
further development
can be traced.</p>

</div>

<p>The larvÃ¦ enter
the Cyclops, according
to most authorities,
by penetrating
the exoskeleton, but
according to Leiper this is impossible; they must enter by the mouth
and penetrate the gut in order to reach the body cavity. In eight days
moult 1 takes place, the striated cuticle being cast off. In ten days
moult 2 takes place. In five weeks the larva is mature. If now the
infected Cyclops is placed in 0Â·2 per cent. HCl solution the Cyclops is
killed immediately, but the larvÃ¦ are stirred into activity, escape from
the body, and swim about in the acid. This suggests that infection
in nature probably takes place by the swallowing of infected Cyclops;
Leiper, by feeding Cyclops containing mature larvÃ¦ to a monkey, found
in it, <i>post mortem</i> six months later, two immature females 30&nbsp;cm. long
and two males 22&nbsp;mm. long.</p>

<p>In certain areas the new cases occur principally in June. Five<span class="pagenum" title="389"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a></span>
weeks later the larvÃ¦ will become mature in Cyclops, so that infection
of Cyclops is taking place in July or August, and from then to June
about ten months elapse, giving the period of development in man.</p>

<p><i>Pathology.</i>&mdash;The initial induration is accompanied by itching.
Urticarial eruptions are described in Dahomey and Mauretania
accompanied by fever, rigors, blood-shot conjunctiva, and prostration
resembling fungus poisoning. Symptoms last for one to two days,
later the worms appear on the surface.</p>

<p>If the worm is ruptured in an attempt to extract it, disastrous
results may occur through the escape of the larvÃ¦ into the tissues:
fever, inflammation, abscess, sloughing, ankylosis, even death from
sepsis. Eosinophilia is often marked, 11 to 13 or even 50 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Extraction.</i>&mdash;(1) The native method consists in rolling the worm
round a stick; 1&nbsp;in. to 2&nbsp;in. are extracted each day, the process
taking about a fortnight; (2) Emily used injections of 1 in 1,000
sublimate into the swelling or into the worm itself fixed by a ligature.<span class="pagenum" title="390"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a></span>

three weeks).</p>

<p><i>CyclopidÃ¦.</i>&mdash;Cephalothorax ovate, clearly separated from abdomen.
Anterior antennÃ¦ of female when bent back scarcely ever stretch

First four pairs of feet two-branched, outer branches three-jointed.
The fifth pair of limbs are rudimentary alike in both sexes, usually

The two spicules are unequal; almost always there are four pre-anal
papillÃ¦, but the number of post-anal papillÃ¦ varies. The vulva is
always situated at the anterior extremity. Parasitic chiefly in the serous
cavities and in the subcutaneous connective tissue. Insufficiently

<p>These parasites of man were for a long time only known in their larval
stage. They were discovered in 1863 in Paris by Demarquay, in the hydrocele
fluid of a Havanese emptied by puncture; they were next observed by WÃ¼cherer,
in Bahia, in the urine of twenty-eight cases of tropical chyluria; they were likewise
observed in North America by Salisbury, who gave them the name of <i>Trichina
cystica</i>. The next discoveries (in Calcutta, Guadeloupe, and Port Natal) related to
chyluria patients, until Lewis discovered the larvÃ¦ in the blood of man (India), and<span class="pagenum" title="391"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a></span>
found they were almost always present in persons suffering from chyluria, elephantiasis,
and lymphatic enlargements; he also, in exceptional cases, found them in
apparently healthy persons (<i>Filaria sanguinis hominis</i>). Lewis and Manson studied
the disease and the filariÃ¦ of the blood very minutely, and became aware that the
filariÃ¦ were sucked up by mosquitoes with the blood. Manson described the
metamorphoses that take place within the body of the mosquito. The adult
female was discovered in Queensland by Bancroft, and soon after Lewis found it
in Calcutta; it was described by Cobbold as <i>F. bancrofti</i>. The male was first
seen by Bourne in 1888.</p></div>

<p>The following data of Rodenwaldt refer to the larvÃ¦ of <i>Filaria
immitis</i> in the dog. They are commoner in organs than in vessels,
and especially in the <i>capillaries</i> of the organs, but in the lungs they
appear to be equally distributed in capillaries, arteries and veins.</p>

<p>The length of life of larvÃ¦ is unknown, but they appear to be
destroyed in the kidneys, as dead calcified specimens are fairly
numerous in the capillaries of the vasa recta of the medullary
substance.</p>

<p>Kidneys: mainly in the glomerular capillaries and those of the

<p><i>Periodicity of LarvÃ¦.</i><a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a>&mdash;Roughly speaking, the larvÃ¦ of <i>Filaria
bancrofti</i> are found in the peripheral blood only during the night,
disappearing (but not entirely) during the daytime. Their periodicity
and that of <i>Loa loa</i> larvÃ¦ is shown by the table on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_394">394</a>, based on
that of Smith and Rivas (<i>Amer. Journ. Trop. Dis. and Prev. Med.</i>,
1914, vol.&nbsp;iii, p.&nbsp;361).</p>

<p>It was discovered by Mackenzie that this periodicity could be
reversed by making the patient sleep during the daytime, showing
that the phenomenon was in some way dependent on sleep or its
attendant phenomena. Rodenwaldt gives the following explanation
of the phenomenon of <span class="nowrap">periodicity:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>MikrofilariÃ¦ come to rest in capillaries. After passing up the
thoracic duct they would reach the capillaries of the lungs by the
superior vena cava. Here they occur in immense numbers. In the
case of <i>Loa loa</i> larvÃ¦ (which have a diurnal periodicity) some of
these are forced out by the increased force and rapidity of the
pulmonary circulation during the day, but are able to rest (owing
to their sticky sheath?) in the peripheral capillaries on their way to
the capillaries of the organs. During the night the force of the
current through the lungs is relaxed and consequently they are able<span class="pagenum" title="394"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a></span>
to remain in the pulmonary capillaries and do not appear in the
capillaries of the systemic circulation. If it is true that the periodicity
of <i>Loa loa</i> cannot be reversed by changing the hours of sleep, then
the explanation is incomplete. In the case of the larvÃ¦ of <i>Filaria
bancrofti</i> (which have a nocturnal periodicity), in order to apply the
same explanation we must further assume that the mikrofilariÃ¦ have
less power of resisting the force of the capillary current (<i>i.e.</i>, are less
sticky). They are washed out of the pulmonary capillaries by day
and by night, but it is only at night, when the blood stream in systemic
capillaries is less rapid, that they are able to rest there. In the daytime
they are washed on until they reach the capillaries of the organs
(possibly again the lungs). The reversal of the periodicity by sleeping
during the daytime admits of a similar explanation. If this explanation
be true, then a prolongation of the day conditions, <i>e.g.</i>, by
continued exercise, should result in still keeping the larvÃ¦ out of the
circulation, but this does not appear to be the case.</p>

<p>In certain countries, <i>e.g.</i>, Fiji, Samoa, Philippines, West Africa,
larvÃ¦, apparently those of <i>Filaria bancrofti</i>, show no periodicity. In
Fiji the usual intermediate host is <i>Stegomyia pseudoscutellaris</i>, a day-biting
mosquito, so that possibly, as Bahr suggests, the mikrofilariÃ¦
have partly adapted themselves to the habits of their intermediate
host, as the nocturnal mikrofilariÃ¦ are adapted for transmission by a
nocturnal feeding mosquito, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Culex fatigans</i>, but how this could
come about is a mystery. It is not certain in all cases whether
the non-periodic mikrofilariÃ¦ really belong to <i>Filaria bancrofti</i>;
some may be <i>L. loa</i> larvÃ¦, or possibly unknown larvÃ¦. An exact
morphological description of these larvÃ¦ is therefore always necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="395"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Preservation of Living LarvÃ¦.</i>&mdash;Blood from the vein (or finger
puncture) is shaken up with twenty times its volume of sterile 0Â·9 per
cent. salt solution, and kept in an ice cupboard (FÃ¼lleborn).</p>

<p><i>Concentration of LarvÃ¦.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) The above mixture is hÃ¦molysed with
water and then sufficient salt solution added to make up to 0Â·9 per
cent. The solution is allowed to stand or can be centrifugalized.
(<i>b</i>) The blood is mixed with sodium citrate and centrifugalized; the
larvÃ¦ are found in the leucocytic layer (Bahr). (<i>c</i>) Allow blood to
clot in a small tube; the larvÃ¦ appear on the surface of the clot and
are so got in pure serum. A drop of blood may also be allowed to
clot on the slide; the larvÃ¦ are found in the clear areas of serum.
(<i>d</i>) HÃ¦molyse blood with water or acetic acid. Centrifugalize, make
smears from, or examine the sediment.</p>

<p><i>Removal of Red Corpuscles.</i>&mdash;The blood film is allowed to stand for
some minutes in a moist atmosphere. The staining solution is sucked
through with blotting paper: the larvÃ¦ stick to the slide, while the
corpuscles are washed out.</p>

<p><i>Morphology of LarvÃ¦.</i>&mdash;Wet staining: Azur II one part, 0Â·9 per
cent., salt solution 3,000, or very dilute Giemsa or ripened methylene
blue or neutral red solutions. Place a drop on the slide and add a
drop of blood to this. The larvÃ¦ remain alive for one or more days;
it sometimes takes twenty-four hours to stain some particular structure.
Differentiation by drawing through weak eosin solution is often
useful. This method is the best for finest details. The excretory
pore, anal pore, excretory cell, and chief âgenitalâ cell stain first,
then the matrix cells and finally the column of nuclei.</p>

<p>Wet fixation and staining: The blood is spread on a large cover-glass&mdash;floated
on the surface of 70 per cent. alcohol heated to about
70Â°&nbsp;C. Wash in water, (1) overstain with 1 in 1,000 azur II solution,
warming slightly; (2) differentiate with (<i>a</i>) absolute alcohol (containing,
if necessary, a trace of HCl), or (<i>b</i>) with absolute alcohol
96 per cent. ninety parts, anilin oil ten parts; (3) clear in origanum,
bergamot or cajeput oil; (4) mount in balsam. Or stain with hÃ¦matoxylin,
<i>e.g.</i>, Mayerâs glycerine alumhÃ¦matein, heating till slightly
steaming. Differentiate with acid (2 per cent. HCl) alcohol if overstained.
Clear and mount as above.</p>

<p>Dry fixation and staining: (1) With azur II as above, or (2) with
hÃ¦matein (warm). Examine the dried films in the usual way without
a cover-glass. The azur stains the excretory and genital cells clearly.</p>

<p>Thick films: (1) The blood is smeared out fairly thickly over an
area as big as a sixpence.</p>

<p>(2) Dry <i>quickly</i> to prevent shrinking, using carefully a spirit lamp
in a moist climate.</p>

<p>(3) Place films downwards in water for a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="396"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a></span></p>

<p>(4) Fix in alcohol.</p>

<p>(5) Stain with azur II, 1 in 1,000. Differentiate as above. Examine
as a dry film. This method suffices for showing the excretory cell and
the G1 cell; or</p>

<p>(6) Stain with hÃ¦matein (slightly steaming), especially for the
column of nuclei and the sheath. The fixation in alcohol in this
case may be omitted.</p>

<p>(7) The removal of the hÃ¦moglobin and the fixation may be
combined by using Rugeâs mixture (formalin 2 per cent., containing
1 per cent. acetic acid) or acetic alcohol (glacial acetic 1, alcohol 3).<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></p>

<p><i>Structure of LarvÃ¦.</i>&mdash;(1) Subcuticular cells: By vital staining, at
intervals underneath the cuticle are seen a series of spindle-shaped
cells&mdash;the <i>subcuticular matrix cells</i> of Rodenwaldt, the <i>muscle cells</i>
of FÃ¼lleborn. There are thirty or forty or more of these.</p>

<p>(2) Nerve ring: Appears as a break in the nuclear column about
20 per cent. of total length from the head.</p>

<p>(3) Excretory system: Consists of a lateral spherical hollow
excretory pore which shows a radial striation. Connected with the
pore is an excretory cell which appears to be canalized. <i>Excretory
pore</i>, 29Â·6 per cent. of length from head. <i>Excretory cell</i>, 30Â·6 per cent.
of length from head.</p>

<p>(4) âGenitalâ cells and anal pore: Consists of a pore opening
ventrally on a very fine papilla with which are connected four
other cells in series, the chief âgenitalâ cell (G1) being some distance
from the three others, which lie close to the pore. G1, 70Â·6 per cent.,
anal pore, 82Â·4 per cent. of length from head.</p>

<p>(5) Internal body, viscus, or reserve material: Best shown by vital
staining with neutral red. This is a granular strand-like body extending
from 52Â·7 per cent. to 65 per cent. of length from head.</p>

<p>(6) Tail end: (i) Rod-like structures resembling those in the head,
90 per cent. of length. (ii) The column of nuclei extends to 95 per cent.
of length, so that the terminal portion is free from nuclei.</p>

<p>(7) Mouth: Terminal according to some authors, lateral according
to others. Some describe a fang on the head, others not. By vital
staining and eosin differentiation two rod-like structures with mushroom-like
caps can be seen behind the head.</p>

<p>(8) Cuticle: Transversely striated. There is a longitudinal break in
the striation on each side corresponding to the lateral lines. The striation
is best shown by vital staining with azur II and eosin differentiation.</p>

<p>(9) Column of nuclei: These nuclei of the gut cells form the
main feature in ordinary dry films stained with hÃ¦matoxylin. They
are separated by a space from the subcuticular cells.</p>

<p><i>Life History.</i>&mdash;In the stomach of the mosquito the larvÃ¦ cast
their sheath in the thickened blood in one to two hours. In twenty-four
hours the majority have reached the thoracic muscles, where
development proceeds. They are at first immobile and of a âsausageâ
form (110Âµ by 13&nbsp;Âµ), with a short spiky tail. In three to five days the
Åsophagus is formed, the larva now being 0Â·5&nbsp;mm. long. The larva
appears to moult at this time. After the gut is formed papillÃ¦, three
or four in number, appear at the tail end. In two to three weeks
the larvÃ¦ are 1Â·5&nbsp;mm. long. They now leave the thorax and reach the
labium, but they may be found in various parts of the body, <i>e.g.</i>, the
legs. They bore through Duttonâs membrane and so arrive on the
surface of the skin, which they rapidly enter. Their development in
man is unknown, but it may be very long, as children are not infected
till 4 to 5, or even 10 years old, but this may be due to unknown
causes.</p>

<p>Development takes place in numerous mosquitoes. Anophelines:
<i>Myzomyia rossii</i>, <i>Pyretophorus costalis</i>, <i>Myzorhynchus sinensis</i>, <i>Myzorhynchus
barbirostris</i>, <i>Myzorhynchus peditÃ¦niatus</i>.</p>

<p>Culicines: <i>Culex pipiens</i>, <i>Culex fatigans</i>, <i>Culex skusei</i>, <i>Culex
gelidus</i>, <i>Culex sitiens</i>, <i>Culex albopictus</i>, <i>Stegomyia fasciata</i>, <i>Stegomyia
pseudoscutellaris</i>, <i>Stegomyia gracilis</i>, <i>Stegomyia perplexa</i>, <i>Mansonioides
uniformis</i>, <i>Mansonioides annulipes</i>, <i>Scutomyia albolineata</i>, <i>TÃ¦niorhynchus
domesticus</i>.</p>

<p>Partial development takes place in other species.</p>

inguinal and epitrochlear, chyluria, chylocele, lymph scrotum,

<p>(2) Out of 257 people with <i>Mf. bancrofti</i> in the blood, 153 were
suffering from filarial diseases, <i>i.e.</i>, 59 per cent.</p>

<p>(3) Whereas of 672 people without <i>Mf. bancrofti</i> in the blood,
only 263 were suffering from filarial diseases, <i>i.e.</i>, 37Â·6 per cent.</p>

<p>(4) Again out of 416 people suffering from filarial disease, 153
showed <i>Mf. bancrofti</i> in their blood, <i>i.e.</i>, 36Â·7 per cent.</p>

<p>It is generally assumed that all people suffering from filarial
disease show at some (presumably early) stage larvÃ¦ in the blood;
but we do not consider that this must necessarily be so. It appears
to us quite possible that living adult filariÃ¦ may be present in the
body, producing disease, without their larvÃ¦ appearing in the blood.
The absence of larvÃ¦ from the blood in 63Â·3 per cent. of persons
suffering from filarial disease is, however, generally explained otherwise.
The adults which occur in enlarged glands, etc., get eventually
destroyed by inflammatory reaction, so that larvÃ¦ are no longer
being produced, while the enlarged gland, etc., which the adults have
produced remains. This explanation assumes that the larvÃ¦ of the
original worm die in the circulation or elsewhere, <i>e.g.</i>, kidney, but
we have no evidence as to the duration of life of larvÃ¦ in the human
body; but also it assumes that a person cannot be reinfected with
filaria, for otherwise there is no reason why the diseased should not be
infected in the same proportion as the non-diseased. But assuming
the explanation to be true, it would explain why a diseased population
show larvÃ¦ in only about one-third of the cases. It must be borne
in mind also that the figures are rather small.</p>

<p><i>Pathology.</i>&mdash;In order to explain the effects which do or may be
expected to occur from obstruction of lymphatics, it is necessary to
have an accurate knowledge of the distribution and connections of<span class="pagenum" title="401"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a></span>
lymphatic vessels (and glands) and the anastomoses of these vessels.
We can only briefly summarize our knowledge here.</p>

<p>We should recall also that considerable destruction or obstruction
of lymphatics or glands may occur without necessarily producing any
lymphatic obstruction, at least, of a permanent nature, <i>e.g.</i>, when a
mass of lymphatic glands is destroyed by a bubo in the groin or,
again, when a carcinomatous mass of glands is removed from the
axilla. Again, to take the case of chyluria&mdash;where it is generally
assumed that obstruction must occur higher up than the point at
which the intestinal lacteals enter the juxta-aortic glands&mdash;this disease
may occur, <i>e.g.</i>, in temperate regions, quite apart from such obstruction.
It is true that some of these cases of chyluria are not cases of
chyle in the urine, but, as little or no fat is present, lymphuria.
These do not require the above assumption, but seeing that true
chyluria may apparently occur without such obstruction, we should
be cautious about explaining this and other symptoms on the basis
of obstructions which theory may demand, for only too often there
are no <i>post-mortem</i> facts at our disposal.</p>

<p>Lymphangitis: What this is due to is unknown. There is no
actual evidence of the occurrence of adults in the inflamed vessel.
Complete disappearance, not to reappear, of (non-periodic) mikrofilariÃ¦
from the blood has been shown by Bahr and others to occur
within twenty-four hours after an attack of lymphangitis, orchitis
adenitis or simply a high temperature. This mysterious phenomenon
requires explanation. If the mikrofilariÃ¦ were being killed by the
attack, their dead bodies should still be found in the blood; or if the
adults were being killed, for all we know to the contrary, the larvÃ¦
might well survive. We consider there is no evidence that either
are affected, but that for some reason, as little understood as in
periodicity, the larvÃ¦ now remain in the organs.</p>

<p>Abscess: In Fiji, by Bahr, they have been found in the substance
of various muscles, <i>e.g.</i>, quadriceps extensor, latissimus dorsi, serratus
magnus, in the popliteal space, groin, axilla, and over the internal condyle
of the humerus, and in the upper extremity they are frequently
infected with cocci. They not infrequently contain fragments of
dead adult filariÃ¦. Their mode of origin is not clear. They form
nearly 30 per cent. of cases of filariasis in Fiji. Of 95 cases, 41
showed mikrofilariÃ¦ in blood, 54 did not.</p>

<p>Hydrocele and enlarged testis: In Fiji they form about 10 per
cent. (36 out of 343) of cases of filariasis. The fluid is usually sterile;
mikrofilariÃ¦ were present in the fluid in 1 out of 11 cases. In the wall
numerous calcified adult filariÃ¦ may be found. The walls consist
chiefly of hypertrophied muscle with fibrous tissue, dilated blood-vessels
and lymphatics, the lining epithelium of which appears to be<span class="pagenum" title="402"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a></span>
absent; of 38 cases 14 had mikrofilariÃ¦ in the blood, 24 had not.
Most of the cases are associated with elephantiasis of the scrotum
(11 out of 12 cases).</p>

<p>Enlarged glands form over 40 per cent. (153 out of 343) of cases
of filariasis, so that they are the commonest expression of filariasis
met with in Fiji. The glands are enlarged, fibrotic, and the trabeculÃ¦
are thickened. The lymphatics are thickened or represented merely
by fibrous tissue. The gland also shows dilated blood-vessels and
numerous spaces filled with lymph. Giant-cells are common in
those glands which contain remnants of filariÃ¦. Masses of lymphocytes
enclosed by inflammatory or fibrous tissue are common.
Eosinophile cells are also extremely common, not only in the fibrous
tissue of the glands, but in other inflammatory or fibrotic conditions:
in other organs living or calcified filariÃ¦ are âusuallyâ present.
Only about 33 per cent. show mikrofilariÃ¦ in the blood. The
epitrochlear gland is frequently enlarged in Fiji.</p>

<p>Breinl has examined enlarged glands and finds loose vascular
fibrous tissue with lymphocytic invasion. In parts, the lymphocytes
collect into areas 200&nbsp;Âµ to 800&nbsp;Âµ in diameter. The lymph tissue
surrounding the spermatic cord showed abundance of vessels&mdash;(1)
large, (2) small. The large had thick walls and wide lumina. In
other cases the lumina were nearly filled by a thrombus of newly
formed, fine, loose connective tissue.</p>

<p>Varicose glands: In about 7 per cent. (24 out of 343 cases) of
filariasis, mikrofilariÃ¦ are found in the blood in 50 per cent. (12 out
of 24).</p>

<p><i>Elephantiasis.</i>&mdash;Elephantiasis scroti is associated with hydrocele
in 50 per cent. of cases (12 out of 23); in 65 per cent. of cases (15 out
of 23) there are associated enlarged glands in one or both groins,
though also hydrocele and enlarged glands occur without elephantiasis
scroti. In 13 out of 27, <i>i.e.</i>, about 50 per cent., cases of elephantiasis
in various regions, no associated enlargement of glands is found.
Elephantiasis forms in Fiji less than 10 per cent. of cases of filariasis.
MikrofilariÃ¦ are present in the blood in 36 per cent. (12 out of 33)
of cases.</p>

<p><i>Chyluria.</i>&mdash;Exceedingly rare in Fiji. Theory would demand an
obstruction above the point of entry of the lacteals, <i>viz.</i>, the pre-aortic
lymphatic glands, but in cases in temperate regions it may occur
without any such lesion. In some of these cases the fluid is not
chyle (fat absent), but presumably lymph. A discussion of the mode
of production of chyluria, lymph scrotum, elephantiasis, etc., is at
present premature; theory has far outrun fact. Too much stress had
been laid on the mechanical action of the worms to the almost total
exclusion of their (or possibly their larval) toxic action. The above<span class="pagenum" title="403"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a></span>
analysis has been made in the hope of acquiring more extended
observations similar to those made by Bahr.</p>

<p><i>Geographical Distribution.</i>&mdash;<i>Filaria bancrofti</i> is known in nearly all
tropical countries. It occurs in India, China, Indo-China, Japan,
Australia, Queensland, the Islands of Polynesia (with the exception
of the Sandwich Islands), Egypt, Algeria, Tunis, Madagascar, Zanzibar,
Sudan, etc., the south of the United States of America, Brazil,
the Antilles, etc. Whether it is the same species in all cases is
questionable.</p>

<p>The adult female <i>F. demarquayi</i> measures from 65 to 80&nbsp;mm.
in length by 0Â·21 to 0Â·25&nbsp;mm. in breadth. The head has a diameter
of from 0Â·09 to 0Â·1&nbsp;mm. The mouth is terminal. The genital
pore opens at 0Â·76&nbsp;mm. from the head. The alimentary canal is
nearly straight and terminates in an anus, which
is subterminal. The opening of the anus is
marked by a slight papilla. The tail is curved.
It rapidly diminishes in size just below the anal
papilla. A characteristic pair of fleshy papillÃ¦
project from the tip of the tail. The diameter near
the tip of the tail before its termination is 0Â·03&nbsp;mm.
<i>F. demarquayi</i> is a thicker worm than <i>Ac. perstans</i>.
It differs from <i>F. bancrofti</i> in the greater size of
the head, in the smaller tail, and particularly in the
marked fleshy papillÃ¦ at the tip of the tail. These
papillÃ¦ are knobby, and not simply cuticular as
in <i>Ac. perstans</i>.</p>

<p>The male of <i>Filaria demarquayi</i> has still to be found.</p>

<p>The adult female form of <i>F. demarquayi</i> was found by Dr. Galgey
in the body of a native of St. Lucia in whose blood the larvÃ¦ had
been found during life. Five adult females were found in the connective
tissue of the mesentery.</p>

<p>The larva measures 200&nbsp;Âµ in length by 5&nbsp;Âµ in breadth; it is sharp-tailed,
and has no sheath. Its movements are very active, and the
absence of a sheath enables it to glide along freely all over the slide.
It observes no periodicity, being present in the peripheral circulation
both by day and by night. As a rule, some eight or ten parasites are
found in an ordinary preparation. Sometimes hundreds of these
larval filariÃ¦ may be counted on every slide.</p>

<p>The sexless Nematodes observed in the lens of the human eye
were termed <i>Filaria oculi humani</i>. Only three cases are known.
v. Nordmann observed very small round worms in the lens of a
man and woman with cataract, and Gescheidt once found three
specimens in the lens of a woman similarly affected.</p>

<p>The demonstration of nematode-like formations in the vitreous
remains uncertain even when movements are observed, and when
they cannot be extracted and examined microscopically the doubt
may occur that one may have mistaken the remains of the hyaloid
artery for a worm, which it resembles in form, size and colour; the
slightest movement of the eye also causes it to move so that it
simulates a living organism.</p>

<p>Accordingly it would be more correct to exclude all the cases known only
ophthalmoscopically (Quadri, 1857; Fano, 1868; Schoeler, 1875; Eversbusch, 1891).
There then remains only one positive case, described by KÃ¼hnt in 1891. In this
case it was possible to follow the gradual growth of the parasite for some time, and
the worm, which measured only 0Â·38&nbsp;mm. in length, was finally extracted.</p></div>

<p><i>Setaria equina</i> is a frequent parasite of horses and asses; it inhabits the

the liver; it is found more rarely in the pleural cavity or in the cranium. The
statement that it also occurs in the subcutaneous connective tissue is probably due
to confusion with <i>Setaria</i> (<i>Filaria</i>) <i>hÃ¦morrhagica</i>, Raill., 1885 (<i>Filaria multipapillosa</i>,

<p>The male measures 25 to 35&nbsp;mm. in length, and 0Â·3 to 0Â·4&nbsp;mm. in
breadth; the cuticle is not striated, but, with the exception of the
anterior and posterior extremities (1Â·5&nbsp;mm.), is beset with numerous
irregularly distributed bosses (4&nbsp;Âµ to 12&nbsp;Âµ high by 12&nbsp;Âµ to 27&nbsp;Âµ
broad). The anterior extremity is somewhat attenuated, and in front
is conical and transversely truncated. At the anterior limit of the
conical part is a small papilla corresponding with the dorsal and ventral
median lines, and a little in front six non-projecting sensory papillÃ¦
(two lateral, four sub-median). Excretory pore 0Â·65&nbsp;mm. from the
anterior end. The posterior extremity is attenuated and somewhat
curved ventrally; the anus is 0Â·082&nbsp;mm. distant from the rounded
posterior border. In front of the anus on each side are three globular
and pedunculated papillÃ¦ of different sizes, set close one behind the
other but asymmetrically; behind the anus on either side are two
smaller papillÃ¦ of a different shape; the anterior one resembles
the pre-anal papillÃ¦ in form, but is smaller; the posterior one is
conical, and rests with a broad base on the cuticle. The spicules
are 0Â·113 and 0Â·176&nbsp;mm. long.</p>

<p>The female measures 45 to 63&nbsp;mm. in length by 0Â·5&nbsp;mm. in
breadth. It is also beset with irregularly distributed bosses, which in
places lie close to each other, and extend to the anterior extremity;
posteriorly they become less frequent, but are not entirely absent.
The anterior extremity is conical, the posterior one straight, attenuated,
rounded off, 0Â·17&nbsp;mm. from the anus. The uteri contain eggs in the
most various stages of development, as well as hatched-out larvÃ¦,
253&nbsp;Âµ to 262&nbsp;Âµ in length and 4Â·7&nbsp;Âµ to 5&nbsp;Âµ in breadth. The vulva lies
about 2&nbsp;mm. from the head end. The vagina, 9&nbsp;mm. long, divides
into two branches, which at first run posteriorly and parallel to one<span class="pagenum" title="410"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a></span>
another for about 18&nbsp;mm. One then bends forward, runs as far as
the Åsophagus, bends here again and runs backward to end at the
point of its first bending. The other branch at first runs straight
backward and then bends forward, but before reaching the point of
the first bend of the anterior tube bends backward again, forms
again a loop and ends at the level of the anus. The tubes consist in
the main of the uterus, then a club-shaped swelling, the receptaculum
seminis, then the oviduct 2&nbsp;mm. long, and finally the ovary.</p>

<p><i>Site of Worms.</i>&mdash;In various localities; under the muscular aponeuroses
on extensor surfaces of arms and legs, fingers, trunk, eyelid,
conjunctiva, frÃ¦num linguÃ¦, penis, pericardium, anterior chamber of
eye, and, according to some authorities, in lymphatic vessels, <i>e.g.</i>,
those of spermatic cord. As many as thirty adults may be found.
The worms appear to be frequently immature, and it has been stated
that worms in superficial parts are immature, those situated deeply
are mature, but the data are few.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first accounts of <i>Loa loa</i>&mdash;long since forgotten&mdash;were reported by
Pigafetta, and are contained in a book of travels on the Congo printed in 1598.
In an accompanying illustration is depicted, not only the ancient method of
extraction of the Medina worm, but also the operative removal of the filaria from
the conjunctiva. Subsequently the presence of the worm in negroes was confirmed
by Bajon in Guiana (1768) and by Mongin in Mariborou (San Domingo), likewise in
a negro (1770). At about this time a French shipâs doctor, Guyot, was cruising on
the West Coast of Africa; he observed the parasite termed âloaâ by the natives,
and learned that it was frequent in the negroes of the Congo district. Since that
time numerous observations have been reported. It was formerly common in South
America, where the parasite was imported by slaves, but it disappeared when the
traffic ceased; it was particularly prevalent in the Congo, where it occurs not only
in natives, but also in Europeans. During recent times it has repeatedly been
observed in Europe in negroes as well as in white men who have lived on the West
Coast of Africa.</p></div>

<p>Nematodes of different size have been repeatedly observed in the
eye of man, in the anterior chamber, lens and vitreous. For example,
Mercier, in 1771 and 1774, removed a filaria out of the anterior
chamber of two negroes in St. Domingo. One was 36&nbsp;mm. long.
Barkan, in 1876, in San Francisco, removed one from the eye of an
Australian. Again, Cappez and Lacompte, in Brussels, in 1894,
observed for some weeks immature Nematodes in the eye of a negro
girl, aged <span class="nowrap">2â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> years, and then removed them. What these Nematodes
actually were in these cases it is impossible to say.</p>

<p><i>Structure of LarvÃ¦.</i>&mdash;In dried films the larva varies in size from
140Â·5&nbsp;Âµ to 166Â·5&nbsp;Âµ, average, 152Â·5&nbsp;Âµ; while another set of measurements
gave the values 131&nbsp;Âµ, to 150&nbsp;Âµ, average, 143Â·6. In films fixed
with hot alcohol the dimensions were 208&nbsp;Âµ to 254&nbsp;Âµ, average, 231&nbsp;Âµ.</p>

<p>The nerve ring 21Â·4 to 21Â·8 per cent. Excretory pore 30Â·4 to 31Â·8
per cent. Excretory cell 34Â·8 to 37Â·3 per cent. G1 cell 68Â·2 to 68Â·5
per cent. Anal pore 81Â·6 to 82Â·4 per cent. of total length. For other
details <i>cf.</i> <i>Filaria bancrofti</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><i>LarvÃ¦ in Blood.</i>&mdash;These from their diurnal periodicity are known
as <i>Mikrofilaria diurna</i>. The evidence that these larvÃ¦ are the young
of the adult worm <i>Loa loa</i> is: (1) They are identical in structure with<span class="pagenum" title="413"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a></span>
larvÃ¦ taken from the uterus of <i>L. loa</i>; (2) their geographical distribution
is the same as that of <i>L. loa</i>; (3) they eventually occur in
the blood of patients suffering from Calabar swellings, a condition
due to <i>L. loa</i>. Their occurrence in the blood in this latter condition
and in <i>L. loa</i> infections we shall consider later.</p>

<p><i>Periodicity.</i>&mdash;Here, as in the case of the larvÃ¦ of <i>Filaria bancrofti</i>,
the larvÃ¦ that appear in the blood
are probably the overflow simply of
the larvÃ¦ which we assume, on
analogy, to have their principal site
in the lungs. They appear in the
blood about the time of getting
up, 6 to 8&nbsp;a.m. (10 in 20 mm.<sup>3</sup>),
at 12 noon there are twenty-four,
at 8&nbsp;p.m. the number has fallen to
eighteen, and at midnight to one,
while from 2&nbsp;a.m. to 6&nbsp;a.m. none,
or one only, may be found. This
periodicity is, as a rule, a very
constant one, but there are exceptions,
and in certain cases more
have been found at midnight than
at 9&nbsp;a.m. The periodicity is also
lost in pathological conditions,
<i>e.g.</i>, sleeping sickness (<i>vide</i> also
under <i>Filaria bancrofti</i>). The
possibility of non-periodic <i>Loa loa</i>
larvÃ¦ should also be considered.</p>

<p><i>Pathology.</i>&mdash;The parasite wanders
about the body, and may be seen
under the skin in thin parts. Their
advance is in some cases at the rate
of an inch in two minutes. During
their progress they give rise to
creeping sensations and to a condition
of transient Ådematous areas
known as Calabar swellings on
various parts of the body, <i>e.g.</i>, arm.
These vary in diameter from 1 to
10&nbsp;cm., and often shift their position an inch or so a day. They give
rise to a certain amount of redness, tension and heat, and their development
is promoted by muscular action of the part. They disappear to
reappear elsewhere. The condition is associated with a high eosinophilia,
50 per cent. being not uncommon. Patients known to harbour<span class="pagenum" title="414"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a></span>
<i>L. loa</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, native children, frequently show no larvÃ¦ in their blood,
but they may do so after years of infection. Again, in patients having
an infection of <i>Mikrofilaria diurna</i>, there is frequently at the time no
evidence of the presence of <i>Loa loa</i> adults. Here again they may
appear later, but the conditions which determine whether persons
infected with <i>L. loa</i> show larvÃ¦ in the blood, or persons infected
with <i>Mikrofilaria diurna</i> also show <i>L. loa</i>, are unknown, though
explanations unsupported by facts
abound. Likewise also the mode
of production of the swellings is
unknown.</p>

<p>Not uncommonly <i>Mikrofilaria
perstans</i> occurs in the blood together
with <i>M. diurna</i>.</p>

<p><i>Duration of Life.</i>&mdash;This is long,
as some cases have been observed
five to six years after leaving
Africa. The incubation period
is about a year.</p>

<p><i>Life-history.</i>&mdash;Development of
the larvÃ¦ takes place in the salivary
glands of Chrysops sp. as shown
by Leiper.</p>

<p><i>Geographical Distribution.</i>&mdash; West

<p><i>Geographical Distribution.</i>&mdash;Very common in many parts of Africa:
Sierra Leone, Dahomey, Northern Nigeria, Southern Nigeria, Cameroons,
Ivory Coast, Gold Coast, Old Calabar, Congo, Uganda. Absent
from Zululand, Basutoland. On the East Coast of Africa it is not
found in the towns of Zanzibar and Mombasa, neither is it found in
the country of the Masi, nor amongst the Kavirondo, who dwell
along the north-east shores of Lake Victoria.</p>

<p>In South America, <i>Ac. perstans</i> is very common amongst the
aboriginal Indians in the interior of British Guiana. However,
it is not found in Georgetown and in New Amsterdam, neither is
it found in the cultivated strip of coast lying between these two
towns, but it is common on the coast farther north near the Venezuelan
boundary, where the forests stretch to the sea. The Waran
Indians, who live at the mouth of the Waini river, harbour this
parasite. It is absent in the West Indies.</p>

<p>Topographically, <i>Ac. perstans</i> is found only in areas covered by
dense forest growth and abounding in swamps. In Kavirondo,
where the forest disappears and the land is covered with scrub and
short grass, it is not found; likewise it is not found on the grassy
plains of the highlands of British East Africa. Towns and cultivated
areas are free from it.</p>

breadth. The body is white, filiform, attenuated at both ends. The
head is rounded and has a diameter of 0Â·048&nbsp;mm. The cuticle<span class="pagenum" title="418"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a></span>
is distinctly transversely striated. The mouth is unarmed. The
alimentary canal is straight, the anus opening 0Â·07&nbsp;mm. from the tip
of the tail. The tail is strongly curved and somewhat flattened on
the concave surface. There are three papillÃ¦, one large and two
small, on each side of the cloaca and one large and two post-anal
small papillÃ¦. Two curved spicules, 0Â·166 and 0Â·08&nbsp;mm. respectively.</p>

<p>The adult female is of uncertain length, but much longer than
the male, probably about 10 to 12&nbsp;cm. The head is rounded and
truncated; it measures 0Â·065&nbsp;mm. in diameter. The tail is curved.
The vulva opens 0Â·55&nbsp;mm. from the head. The hand-like cuticular
thickenings are well marked. Eggs ovoid with a prolongation at
each pole âlike an orange wrapped in tissue paper.â The larva
measures about 300&nbsp;Âµ by 7&nbsp;Âµ to 8&nbsp;Âµ; it has no âsheath.â The body
tapers from about the last fifth of its length, and terminates in a
sharply pointed tail. At about the anterior fifth of the body there
is a <b>V</b> spot.</p>

<p><i>O. volvulus</i> is found in peculiar subcutaneous tumours, the size of
a pea to that of a pigeonâs egg. The same patient may present one
or several of these tumours. The regions of the body most frequently
affected are those in which the peripheral lymphatics converge.
Thus they are usually found in the axilla, in the popliteal
space, about the elbow, in the sub-occipital region and in the intercostal
spaces. The tumours are never adherent to the surrounding
structures, and can be easily enucleated. They are formed of a dense
connective tissue wall and internally a looser fibrous meshwork.
This is traversed by a series of canals in which the worms lie, but
they are also partly embedded in the denser wall. The canals
apparently dilate into cavities filled with slimy pus-like fluid consisting
largely of larvÃ¦. According to Brumpt the posterior extremity
of the male, and the anterior extremity of the female with its vaginal
opening, are free in one of the spaces for the purpose of copulation
and parturition. If a tumour be cut into and placed in salt solution,
Rodenwaldt states that the undamaged males wander out into the
solution.</p>

<p>The formation of the tumours is elucidated by Labadie-Lagrave
and Deguyâs case. The authors found an immature female <i>Onchocerca
volvulus</i> in a lymphatic vessel partly obstructed by an infiltration of
fibrin and leucocytes. It appears, therefore, that the presence of the
parasites within the lymphatics gives rise to an inflammatory process,
and that the consequent fibrinous deposit envelops the parasites,
obliterates the lumen of the vessel, and ultimately isolates the affected
tract. At any rate, in young tumours the worms appear to lie in
a structureless substance permeated by leucocytes in which connective
tissue is gradually organized from the periphery, thus isolating the
worms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="419"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a></span></p>

<p>In cases of infection with <i>O. volvulus</i> larvÃ¦ have been found by
Ouizilleau, FÃ¼lleborn, and Simon in lymph glands, and in the finger
blood if considerable pressure is used so as to squeeze lymph out
of the tissues. They are <i>sheathless</i>, and the following are the
dimensions in ordinary dried films: Length, 274&nbsp;Âµ; nerve ring,
23Â·7 per cent.; G1 cell, 69Â·6 per cent.; end of last tail cell, 96Â·3 per
cent. The dimensions of larvÃ¦ of <i>O. volvulus</i> taken from the uterus
and prepared in the same way are: Length, 224Â·5&nbsp;Âµ; nerve ring,
24Â·3 per cent.; G1 cell, 68Â·9 per cent.; end of the last tail cell,
95Â·5 per cent. In all probability the larvÃ¦ in the glands and blood
are those of <i>O. volvulus</i>.</p>

<p>According to the natives, the tumours may last indefinitely and
never ulcerate. Some old patients told Brumpt that their tumours
had been present since childhood. Probably <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i>,
like some other <i>FilariidÃ¦</i>, may live for many years.</p>

<p><i>O. volvulus</i> occurs in various parts of West Africa: Gold Coast,
Sierra Leone, Dahomey, Lagos, Cameroons. Brumpt, on the banks
of the Welle between Dongon and MâBinia (Belgian Congo), found
about 5 per cent. of the riverine population affected.</p>

<p>The whip worm is one of the most common
parasites of man and appears to be distributed

more frequent in the warmer regions. It
is found in persons of both sexes and all ages
with the exception of infants. In autopsies it

in 45 per cent., in North Holland in 7 per cent.,
in Novgorod in 26Â·4 per cent., in Petrograd
in 5 per cent., in Moscow in 5Â·3 per cent.</p></div>

<p>The development of the eggs is completed in water or in moist
soil, and occupies a longer or shorter time according to the season;
the eggs possess great powers of resistance, as do the larvÃ¦, which,
according to Davaine, may remain as long as five years in the eggshell
without losing their vitality. Leuckart proved by experiment
that direct infection with <i>Trichuris ovis</i> (<i>Ovis aries</i>) and <i>T. crenata</i>
(<i>Sus scrofa dom.</i>) was produced by embryo-containing eggs; Railliet
obtained the same results with <i>T. depressiuscula</i> of dogs, and Grassi
subsequently, by means of two experiments, demonstrated the direct
development of <i>Trichuris trichiura</i>. In one case embryo-containing
eggs were swallowed on June 27, 1884, and on July 24 the ova of
Trichocephali were found in the fÃ¦ces for the first time.</p>

<p><i>Trichinella spiralis</i> in its adult stage inhabits the small intestine
of man, pig, wild boar, rat. The young do not leave the body of the
host but become encysted in the muscles. Experimentally it develops
in the black rat (<i>Mus rattus</i>), the sewer rat (<i>M. decumanus</i>), the
domestic pig (<i>Sus scrofa dom.</i>), the wild boar (<i>Sus scrofa ferox</i>), the
domestic dog (<i>Canis familiaris</i>), the fox (<i>C. vulpes</i>) the badger (<i>Meles
taxus</i>), the polecat (<i>Putorius fÅtidus</i>), the marten (<i>Mustela foina</i>), the
raccoon (<i>Procyon lotor</i>), the hippopotamus and the cat, and many
other mammals (rodents and carnivora); TrichinellÃ¦ have been artificially
introduced, by administering the encysted stage, into the dog,
the mole (<i>Talpa europÃ¦a</i>), the mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>), the hare (<i>Lepus
timidus</i>), the rabbit (<i>L. cuniculus</i>), the hedgehog (<i>Erinaceus europÃ¦us</i>),
the marmot (<i>Cricetus vulgaris</i>), the vole, the dormouse, the sheep, the
calf, the horse, etc. Human beings and the pig, rat, mouse, guinea-pig
and rabbit are most easily infected; less easily the sheep, calf and
horse; with difficulty the cat, dog and badger. Trichinella can also
be reared in birds (fowl, pigeon and duck), but the young do not<span class="pagenum" title="422"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a></span>
encyst in the muscular system, but are expelled with the fÃ¦ces. By
cold-blooded animals as well as by insects (<i>Calliphora vomitaria</i>),
encysted TrichinellÃ¦ are evacuated without undergoing any change,
but they will still develop if subsequently ingested, say, by rabbits.
According to Gujon, however, Trichinella can develop in salamanders,<span class="pagenum" title="423"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a></span>
because he has found Trichinella of the muscles in these animals
after they had been fed on encysted specimens. A high temperature
(30Â°C.) must be provided in which to keep the experimental animals
to ensure the success of the infection.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Encapsuled TrichinellÃ¦ had been observed in London by Peacock
(1828) and by J. Hilton (1833) in the muscular system of man; soon after
(1835), Paget found them in London in an Italian who had died of tuberculosis,
and recognized them to be encysted entozoa, which R. Owen described as <i>Trichina
spiralis</i>. Soon after, some further observations were reported on the occurrence of
encysted TrichinellÃ¦, in man, in England, Berlin, Heidelberg, Denmark, North
America; they were also found in the pig (Leidy, Philadelphia) and the cat (Herbst,
GÃ¶ttingen, and Gurlt, Berlin). Herbst even succeeded in infecting a badger with
encysted TrichinellÃ¦, and subsequently infected two dogs with the flesh of this
badger (1850). In 1855 R. Leuckart (Giessen) also commenced feeding experiments,
and, like KÃ¼chenmeister and Virchow (1859), first went on the wrong track because
it was believed at that time that TrichinellÃ¦ were the larvÃ¦ either of Trichocephalus
or Strongylus. Nevertheless, these experiments yielded some important results;
they showed that TrichinellÃ¦ become adult in the intestine within a few days, and
that the females are viviparous (Leuckart). Until that time TrichinellÃ¦ had been
regarded as fairly harmless guests of man, but opinions soon changed when Zenker
in Dresden (January, 1860), in performing the autopsy of a girl, aged 10, who had
entered the hospital with typhoid symptoms and there died, found TrichinellÃ¦ (not
yet encysted) in the muscles; the intestinal lesions characteristic of typhoid were
lacking, but numerous adult TrichinellÃ¦ were found in the intestine. Inquiries
elicited the fact that at about Christmas time the girl had been taken ill after eating
pork, and at the same time the butcher from whom the meat was bought as well
as several of his customers fell sick: the pickled pieces of the same meat were full
of TrichinellÃ¦. In the face of this information it was not difficult to ascertain the
cause of the disease and the manner of infection in Zenkerâs case, and it was not
long before Leuckart, Virchow and Zenker were able by renewed experiments to
demonstrate the cycle of development of <i>Trichinella spiralis</i>. Similar investigations
followed by Claus in WÃ¼rzburg, Davaine in Paris, Fuchs and Pagenstecher in
Heidelberg, etc.</p>

<p>Hardly had Zenkerâs case been published than numerous observations on
trichinosis in man appeared, some referring to isolated cases, others to small or
great epidemics, and nearly all from North Germany. The worst epidemic was
that of Hadersleben (1865), in which place, numbering hardly 2,000 inhabitants,
337 persons were taken ill within a short time, and of these 101 died. The source
of infection proved to be a single pig, the flesh of which had been mixed with that
of three other pigs; 200 of the badly infected persons had exclusively eaten raw
pork.</p>

<p>Moreover, it soon became clear that epidemics of trichinosis had been observed
in Germany prior to 1860, but that their nature had not been recognized, although
in a few cases TrichinellÃ¦ had been found in the muscles of those who had
succumbed.</p></div>


<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">History of the Development of</span> <i>Trichinella spiralis</i>.</p>

<p>Shortly after their introduction into the intestine of experimental
animals the encysted TrichinellÃ¦ escape from their capsules, which
are destroyed by the gastric juices, and they then enter the duodenum<span class="pagenum" title="424"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a></span>
and jejunum, where they become adult. During this period they do
not grow much, the males from 0Â·8 to 1Â·0 to 1Â·2 to 1Â·5&nbsp;mm.; the
females to 1Â·5 to 1Â·8&nbsp;mm. Soon after copulation, which takes place
in the course of two days, the males die; the females, which during
the following days attain a length of 3 to 3Â·5&nbsp;mm., either bore more
or less deeply into the villi or, by means of LieberkÃ¼hnâs glands, into
the mucous membrane (Askanazy, Cerfontaine, Geisse), and thus
usually attain the lymph spaces. A few also pierce the intestinal wall
and are then found in the mesentery and glands. The females deposit
their young, the number of which, according to Leuckart, averages at
least 1,500, in the lymph spaces; the newly born larvÃ¦ measure 90&nbsp;Âµ to
100&nbsp;Âµ in length, 6&nbsp;Âµ in diameter, and they do not appear to increase in
size during their migrations. The migrations are mostly passive, that
is to say, the larvÃ¦ are carried along mainly by the lymph stream to
the heart, but sometimes they are active, as may be inferred from the
fact that young TrichinellÃ¦ are found in various parts of the intestinal
wall beyond the chyle and lymph spaces, as well as in abundance
in the abdominal cavity. TrichinellÃ¦ occur in the heartâs
blood of artificially infected animals seven to twenty-three days
after infection. If scanty, dilute the blood with about ten times the
amount of 3 per cent. acetic acid and centrifugalize.</p>

<p>The young brood is distributed from the heart throughout the
entire body, but the conditions necessary to its further development
are found only in striated muscle; the young Nematodes penetrate
the capillaries, attain the intramuscular connective tissue and then
invade the fibres (Virchow, Leuckart, Graham<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a>). On the ninth or
tenth day after infection the first TrichinellÃ¦ have reached their
destination; but further invasions are constantly taking place because
the intestinal TrichinellÃ¦ live from five to seven weeks, and continue
to produce their young.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>&mdash;(1) Period of invasion: Gastro-intestinal symptoms&mdash;nausea,
vomiting, watery diarrhÅa, colic. Muscular pains may occur
even at this period. Recurrent abdominal pains about the eighth day,
a <i>temporary</i> Ådema. Embryos are abundant in the serous cavities.</p>

<p>(2) Period of dissemination: Second week. Myositis, variable in
amount, is the predominant symptom. The biceps and calf may be
hard and tender. Mastication, speech, respiration, etc., may be
difficult and painful. DyspnÅa may be intense. Temperature
104Â° to 105Â°&nbsp;F.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="425"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"></a></span></p>

<p>(3) Period of encystment: Symptoms of marked cachexia. Third
week: Second period of Ådema, especially of face. Delirium,
somnolence, lung affections. Death or gradual subsidence of
symptoms in mild cases.</p>

<p>Eosinophilia (50 per cent. or more) is present.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In consequence of the new batches of young produced during several weeks,
the above-mentioned symptoms of disease are often considerably aggravated; the
fever increases, delirium may arise, and infiltration of the lungs, fatty degeneration
of the liver and inflammation of the kidneys may ensue; the initial slight Ådema
may extend, the strength dwindles, and in many cases the patients succumb to the
trichinosis. In severe cases improvement of the condition is only apt to occur
in the fourth or fifth week; the convalescence is always protracted.</p></div>

</div>

<p>The muscular fibres attacked degenerate, the transverse striation
at first disappearing; the fibres then assume a granular appearance,
the nuclei multiply and become enlarged, and are surrounded by an
area of granular material, which stains more deeply than the remaining
contents of the sarcolemma. Two or three weeks after infection, the
spirally rolled-up TrichinellÃ¦ have grown to 0Â·8 to 1Â·0&nbsp;mm., and in
their vicinity the muscular fibre is swollen, spindle-shaped, and the<span class="pagenum" title="426"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a></span>
sarcolemma is glassy and thickened. The inflammation also extends
to contiguous fibres, especially to the intramuscular tissue, which
proliferates greatly, especially in the vicinity of the degenerated fibres.
While the latter become more and more absorbed, the capsule is
formed by the inflamed connective tissue, which, penetrating into the
glassy and thickened sarcolemma from the poles of the spindle, forms
the cystic membrane. According to other authorities, the larvÃ¦ settle
in the <i>inter</i>muscular connective tissue which forms the cyst and not
in the muscular fibres within the sarcolemma. The cysts are lemon-shaped
and usually lie with their longitudinal axis in the direction of
the muscular fibres; on an average they measure 400&nbsp;Âµ in length by
250&nbsp;Âµ in breadth.</p>

<p>Later on fat cells appear at their poles, and after about six or
nine months they commence to calcify, the process starting at the
poles (fig.&nbsp;305). Finally, sometimes after the lapse of years, the
captive TrichinellÃ¦ themselves become calcified.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>According to experience, TrichinellÃ¦ are not evenly distributed
in the muscular system of pigs; the diaphragm, the muscles of the
larynx, tongue, abdomen and intercostal spaces are their favourite
positions; this predilection for the respiratory muscles is explained
by their regular contractions, owing to which regular narrowings
of the capillaries take place, thus favouring the settling of the circulating
TrichinellÃ¦. The same circumstance probably explains the
frequency of the parasites in the tongue.</p>

<p>Possibly also the TrichinellÃ¦ that bore direct through the intestine
may, from the abdominal cavity, penetrate the muscles in the vicinity.
Frequently also encysted TrichinellÃ¦ are found in remarkable numbers<span class="pagenum" title="427"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a></span>
in the vicinity of the points of insertion of the tendons, this proclivity
being probably connected with the fact that the TrichinellÃ¦
first of all wander into the muscular fibres and find a natural barrier
at the points of insertion of the tendons.</p>

<p>The TrichinellÃ¦, in their encysted condition, may remain alive
and capable of development for many years&mdash;in the pig eleven years
and in man as much as twenty-five to thirty-one years. Encystment,
however, is not a necessary condition for the development of the
brood, that is to say, TrichinellÃ¦ which reach the gut of suitable
animals become sexually mature and multiply provided that they have
developed so far as to possess a rudimentary genital spot, which
occurs when the body is 0Â·5 to 0Â·75&nbsp;mm. long, but all the same
a great part of non-encapsuled TrichinÃ¦ perish on their passage
through the stomach.</p>

<p>The black rat (<i>Mus rattus</i>), and more particularly the sewer rat
(<i>Mus decumanus</i><a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a>), are the normal hosts of <i>Trichinella spiralis</i>. These
animals, especially the last-named species, infect themselves very
easily, as they are cannibalistic, and they also transmit trichinosis
to other species by which they are devoured, such as pigs, dogs,
cats, foxes, bears and martens. Rats are infected also by the ingestion
of fÃ¦cal matter from infected animals which contains
trichinÃ¦ (HÃ¶yberg). Man becomes infected with Trichinella by
eating the flesh, insufficiently cooked, of infected pigs, also, but
more rarely, by eating the infected flesh of wild boars, dogs, cats,
bears and foxes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The infection of pigs may likewise take place by their having access to the offal
of trichinous pigs, or being actually fed on it. These are, however, exceptions,
which, as a matter of course, are of great importance in certain places. As
a matter of fact, the rats examined for Trichinella were always found to be severely
infected. Thus Billings, in the knackersâ yard at Boston, found that 76 per cent.
of the rats were infected, and in an export slaughterhouse 100 per cent. were found
to harbour the parasite; in the city of Boston 10 per cent. of the rats had trichinosis.
Heller found that of 704 rats, from twenty-nine different places in Saxony, Bavaria,
WÃ¼rtemberg and Austria, 8Â·3 per cent. were infected with TrichinellÃ¦; of the rats
caught in the knackersâ yards, 22Â·1 were diseased; of those taken in slaughterhouses,
2Â·3 were infected, and of rats from other localities only 0Â·3 per cent.
harboured the parasite. Leisering found almost the same figures, but in rats from
slaughterhouses 5Â·3 per cent. were infected.</p></div>

<p>The geographical distribution of <i>T. spiralis</i> does not correspond
with the occurrence of trichinosis in man; local customs are<span class="pagenum" title="428"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a></span>
an important factor; for instance, the custom of eating pork in
a condition that does not affect the life of the enclosed trichinella.
In places where such customs do not prevail, epidemics do not
occur&mdash;at the most there are isolated cases of the disease, although
there be a great number of infected pigs. The following conditions
prevail in North America: In Boston, Billings found that 4 to 5Â·7 per
cent. of the pigs examined were trichinous; Belfield and Atwood
found that 8 per cent. were infected in Chicago; Salmon found
on an average that 2Â·7 per cent. were infected (but at various places
the percentage fluctuated between 0Â·28 to 16Â·3 per cent.), yet epidemics
of trichinosis hardly ever occur in North America, and only isolated
cases of the disease are met with in German immigrants, who keep
to their native customs.</p>

<p>This report, according to the researches of H.&nbsp;U. Williams, must be considerably
modified. This author has examined the muscular system of human cadavers
according to the method employed by inspectors of meat for pigs. The investigations
were conducted in the Pathological Institute of the University of Buffalo, and
the observer has examined 505 bodies since 1894, of which 27 (= 5Â·34 per cent.)
were invaded by Trichinella. The cases, according to the nationality, are divided

<p>It is worthy of remark that half of all the positive cases were mental patients,
who were found to be affected with Trichinella to well-nigh 12 per cent. Trichinosis
was not, however, the cause of death in any case. Very frequently the TrichinellÃ¦
were found calcified and dead.</p></div>

<p>Conditions are similar in most countries of Europe, where, of
course, the number of infected pigs is considerably smaller, but
the disease depends less on this than on the way in which the
pork is prepared.</p>

<p>Cases of trichinosis have been known to occur in nearly all
the countries of Europe; further, in Egypt, Algeria, East Africa,
Syria, India, Australia, and America. North Germany, more<span class="pagenum" title="429"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429"></a></span>
especially the Saxe-ThÃ¼ringian states, is the classical land for
epidemics of trichinosis; the mortality varies, but it may be
very high.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Prophylaxis.</i>&mdash;The grave nature of the disease and the comparatively high
mortality relating to trichinosis led the authorities to adopt certain preventive
measures, which are the more necessary as national customs cannot be altered in
a short time. As the usual process of pickling and smoking, even when long
continued, does not certainly ensure the death of the TrichinellÃ¦ contained in the
meat, and also because in roasting and boiling large pieces of pork a considerable
time is necessary to permit the temperature required to kill off the parasites
(62Â° to 70Â°&nbsp;C.) to penetrate to the middle of the joint, it appeared to be most
practical to have all pigs microscopically examined for TrichinellÃ¦ before they, or
parts of them, were placed on the market, and all infected meat condemned, no
matter whether the TrichinellÃ¦ were present in large or small numbers, still
undeveloped or calcified. Since 1877 obligatory examination of pork has been
introduced in Prussia, though as yet it is not thoroughly carried out; other states
of North Germany as well as the larger towns of South Germany soon followed;
a complete army of trichina inspectors, officially examined and periodically controlled
by experts, and whose number in Prussia amounted to 27,602 in 1896,
this being even increased to 28,224 in 1899, have the charge of examining
pork on certain lines laid down. These are at the present time uniformly
administered. The proceeding is usually that the trichina inspector himself goes to
the slaughterhouses, or special samplers take pieces of the muscles that are known
to be the favourite seats of the parasite (pillars of the diaphragm, the costal part of
the diaphragm, muscles of the tongue and larynx, intercostal and abdominal muscles);
six small portions are separated from each piece, pressed between slides or special
compressors, and carefully gone through by examining them with a low power of
the microscope. The pigs free from TrichinellÃ¦ are passed for commerce; trichinous
pigs, on the other hand, in Prussia, are only allowed to be used for industrial
purposes, <i>i.e.</i>, the hide and bristles are used, the fat is allowed to be melted down,
or certain parts are used for the manufacture of soap or glue. In Saxony, however,
it is still permitted to place trichinous flesh on the market, fully declaring its nature,
and after having been heated to its deepest strata at a temperature of 100Â°&nbsp;C. in a
suitable apparatus, and under the supervision of a veterinary surgeon.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the excellent preventive measure of
official inspection for Trichinella has led to the avoidance of grave
disasters; its introduction has not yet caused an entire cessation
of trichinosis in man, because inspection of pork is not obligatory<span class="pagenum" title="431"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431"></a></span>
everywhere, so that human beings may become infected by
unexamined trichinous pigs from their own country or from abroad,
and also because an infection may occasionally escape notice. For
these reasons the meat imported into Berlin from abroad as free
from TrichinÃ¦ is examined again and not always in vain; finally, also,
gross negligence may at times occur, or fatal errors may be made.</p>

<p>In addition <i>private prophylaxis</i> must not be neglected, and its
chief aim should be directed to the suitable preparation of pork.</p>

The anus is crescent-shaped and terminal. The vulva is 50 to

<p><i>Dioctophyme gigas</i> lives in the pelvis of the kidney, more rarely in
the abdominal cavity of the seal, otter, dog, wolf, fox, horse, marten
and polecat, exceptionally also in human beings. It also occurs in
tumours of the mamma and perinÃ¦um. Most of the cases in which
this parasite has been reported as occurring in man may be traced
back to unrecognized <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> or to clots of fibrin; seven
certain cases, eight more or less doubtful, however, remain.</p>

<p>The source of infection is unknown, but according to Balbiani the
eggs develop an embryo in water or moist soil,
and this embryo may remain alive several years
without hatching; the infection of dogs with
embryo-containing eggs did not succeed; an
intermediate stage in fishes is conjectured,
but still the infection of cattle and horses is
unintelligible.</p>

in sheep and in man; in young pigs it is apt to set up
a bronchitis, which frequently causes death.</p>

<p>The first communication as to the occurrence of this species in
man was that of Diesing, who, in 1845, in Klausenburg, had the
opportunity of examining <i>StrongylidÃ¦</i> found by Jortsits in the lung
of a little boy, aged 6, in Transylvania; probably also the Nematodes
found in the trachea and
larynx of man, and described by
Rainey and Bristowe as specimens
of <i>Filaria trachealis</i>, belong to
this group; according to Chatin,
<i>Metastrongylus apri</i> may also occur
in the intestine of man; this occurrence,
however, may in all
probability have been due to an
accidental introduction of adult
worms into the intestine, and
should not be attributed to an
infection by the larval stage.</p>

<p>No experiments to induce infection
have been made; it is probable,
however, that infection is
direct and without the aid of an
intermediate host.</p>

producing dysentery, and in man (Northern Nigeria).</p>

<p>According to Walker this species is common in Philippine monkeys.
Ova are scanty in the fÃ¦ces. They measure 73&nbsp;Âµ to 84&nbsp;Âµ by 44&nbsp;Âµ to
57&nbsp;Âµ and are in the morula stage. They are easily cultivated. The
rhabditiform larva is 340&nbsp;Âµ by 16&nbsp;Âµ and has a long filiform tail. It
moults twice, and at the second moult becomes a filariform larva
retaining the skin of this moult, this stage being that of the mature
larva. It now measures 9&nbsp;mm. long by 30&nbsp;Âµ thick. Walker suggests
that the mode of infection is similar to that of ancylostomes.</p>

<p><i>Buccal Capsule.</i>&mdash;The buccal capsule is bent dorsally, 0Â·21&nbsp;mm.
long, 0Â·19&nbsp;mm. broad. If a worm is rolled under the cover-glass so
that the dorsal side is upwards, we observe the following features
(fig.&nbsp;325): In the dorsal edge of the chitinous capsule there is a gap
as if a <b>U</b>-piece had been punched out. This is the âdorsal gap or
incision.â The so-called âdorsal teethâ are simply the rounded
edges of the tips of this gap. They project <i>beyond</i> the skin which
covers the capsule externally. Below this gap is seen a curved line
which, if followed along the sides of the capsule on each side, merges
into the base of the most posterior ventral tooth. This line is the
optical expression of a very shallow groove on the <i>inside</i> of the
capsule. The skin on the outside of the capsule, which is reflected
over the edge of and into the capsule, dips into this groove, which
gives it a firm attachment. Below the middle (dorsally) of this curved
line there is a thickening in the capsule wall, which is perforated by the
opening of the dorsal Åsophageal gland. This is the âdorsal ridgeâ; in
optical section it has a conical appearance with a lumen (of the duct).</p>

0Â·6&nbsp;mm. thick. Pale flesh colour, or an intense red in posterior third.
Anteriorly may be more or less black due to (blood) pigment in the
cells of the chyle intestine (= stomach + small intestine). The worm
is about the same thickness all through and is plump and rigid.
Cuticle striated. The body has a marked torsion, so that if the ventral
side of the head is upwards the anus appears to open laterally and
<i>vice versÃ¢</i>. The dorsal curve of the head end is only slight and
the Åsophagus is roughly cylindrical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="446"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a></span></p>
<p>On the ventral wall one sees the two pairs of strong teeth, their
points being directed somewhat backwards. They are covered by
cuticle above and below, but their points are free, piercing the cuticle.
The ârootsâ of these teeth followed backwards appear as two
thickenings or ribs on the <i>outside</i> of the capsule wall, so that the
outside wall is not smooth&mdash;a characteristic of the genus Ancylostoma.
In the space between these ribs lies the ventral nerve papilla,<span class="pagenum" title="447"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a></span>
and lying against the outside of the outer root the lateral nerve
papilla. The nerve papillÃ¦ are thus, as it were, concealed by these
roots, and not conspicuous as they are in Necator. Following the
ventral curve of the capsule on the inside, posteriorly we next find
two triangular ventral lancets.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> These stand straight up into the
capsule on either side of the longitudinal axis, converging at their
summits. So that to sum up, the cutting apparatus is entirely
ventral, consisting of two pairs of cutting teeth and a pair of lancets.</p>

<p><i>Cervical PapillÃ¦.</i>&mdash;Two, one on each side behind the head at the
level of the excretory pore. They consist of âpulp,â <i>i.e.</i>, extensions
of the substance of the lateral
bands covered by cuticle and
supplied with a nerve (fig.&nbsp;326).</p>

</div>

<p><i>Åsophageal Glands</i> (3).&mdash;The
chitin of the triradiate
Åsophagus is continuous with
that of the buccal capsule. In
its muscular walls are three
glands&mdash;one dorsal, two sub-ventral.
The dorsal gland opens
into the buccal cavity through
the dorsal ridge; the two others
into the lumen of the Åsophagus
at the nerve ring. They
branch freely amidst the muscles.
They are probably digestive in
function.</p>

<p><i>Cephalic Glands</i> (2).&mdash;Lie in
the lateral lines or bands on
either side. They begin about
the middle line of the body, and their ducts open at the base of the outer
ventral tooth on the surface of the skin on each side. Each is 0Â·15&nbsp;mm.
thick in the middle, and has a single nucleus about as big as an ancylostome
egg (<i>N</i>, fig.&nbsp;323). They probably function as poison glands.</p>

<p><i>Excretory System and Cervical Glands</i> (2).&mdash;The excretory pore lies
in the mid line ventrally behind the Åsophageal nerve ring (figs.&nbsp;324
and 326). It opens into the excretory vesicle, a cavity in a large
cell with lateral appendages which fuse with the lateral lines, this
cell thus forming the âbridgeâ of the excretory system. Adhering
to this (bridge) cell are the spindle-shaped cervical glands (<i>Glc</i>,
fig.&nbsp;324), and branches from the excretory vesicle enter the glands,
which are excretory in function; the vesicle also receives branches<span class="pagenum" title="448"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"></a></span>
from the lateral excretory canals (fig.&nbsp;326) running in the lateral
lines or bands. The cervical glands are swollen anteriorly, forming
the so-called ampullÃ¦ just in front of the bridge. They extend
backwards a little beyond the anterior loop of the testis.</p>

<p><i>Lateral Lines.</i>&mdash;(1) Are broad elevations of the subcuticle, in
which, here and there, a nucleus occurs. (2) Near the bursa in the
male they increase in volume, and finally divide into branches which
form the âpulpâ of the different rays. (3) In addition to the lateral
lines or bands, there is also a dorsal and ventral band. (4) The
ventral band is well developed caudally, forming a large pad dorsal
to the cloaca, âpulvillus post-analis.â</p>

<p>The bursal rays are outgrowths of the lateral lines. Beside this
âpulpâ they contain a nerve, and at their bases complex muscles.</p>

<p><i>The Bursa</i> is closed on all sides with a short median (ventral) lobe,
which may be tucked inwards. It is an outgrowth of the inner layer
of the skin pushing the outer layer before it, so that it consists of three
layers, not four, as it would be if it were a fold. The bursa is twice
as broad as long. It is supported by a variety of rays, the arrangement
of which is best followed from the figure (fig.&nbsp;327). The<span class="pagenum" title="449"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449"></a></span>
different terminology for these rays as used by various authors
should be noted: Ventral = anterior; externo-lateral = antero-external;
medio-lateral + postero-lateral or antero-median + postero-median
= median (doubled); externo-dorsal = postero-external;
dorsal = posterior. All the rays end in tactile papillÃ¦, seven, on each
side; the postero-external and antero-external on the <i>outer</i> surface of
the bursa, the five others on the <i>inner</i> surface.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> Of the six terminal
digitations of the <i>dorsal</i> ray, only the external two contain tactile
papillÃ¦.</p>

<p>In the male there are prebursal papillÃ¦ and minute caudal papillÃ¦
in the female.</p>

<p>In the female the inner layer of the cuticle projects at the posterior
end as a sharp spike, 20&nbsp;Âµ long, which may sometimes be broken off.</p>

<p><i>Ovaries.</i>&mdash;The anterior tube runs from the cephalic to the posterior
end and back again. The posterior tube begins anteriorly, runs to the
posterior end of the body, and then back to the cephalic end, forming
a vulval loop before ending. The ovaries on the whole run in
oblique coils. The uterus is the thicker portion of the tube, 5&nbsp;mm.
long. A short tube connecting the ovary and uterus is the oviduct.
The two uteri unite to form a single duct, the vagina, opening 1&nbsp;mm.
<i>behind</i> the middle line. The portion of the uterus next to the oviduct
functions as a seminal receptacle, whereas the part next the vagina
functions as an ovejector.</p>

<p><i>Testis.</i>&mdash;The blind end begins a little behind the beginning of
the <i>cement gland</i>. The transverse coils occupy the middle third of
the body. About the middle of the body it passes into the spindle-shaped
seminal vesicle, which, with the spicular canal and rectum,
opens into the cloaca. An anterior longitudinal coil pushing in
between the cervical glands is characteristic of Ancylostoma. The
cement gland surrounds the ejaculatory duct for practically its whole
course, and it occupies nearly the posterior half of the body and<span class="pagenum" title="450"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450"></a></span>
secretes a brown or black cement. The spermatozoa are curved
rods about 2&nbsp;Âµ long.</p>

<p><i>Spicules</i> are 2&nbsp;mm. long, ending in a fine point. They are moved
by exsertor and retractor muscles. At first they lie free in the body
cavity; next in a groove in the dorsal wall of the cloaca; then in an
isolated canal, and finally in two canals. Anteriorly each has two
longitudinal crests on its inner surface. These meet the corresponding
crests of the other spicule, and so form a canal along which the
sperm passes into the female. The gubernaculum is a thickening
of the dorsal wall of the cloaca. It is not a free piece, but is moved
by various muscles.</p>

much more prominent in <i>Necator americanus</i>.</p>

association with <i>Necator americanus</i> in Southern States of America,
British India, Assam, Burma, Hongkong, Liberia, Jamaica, Martinique,

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&mdash;The worms live in the jejunum, less frequently in the
duodenum, of man only.</p>

<p><i>Food.</i>&mdash;The worms feed on the mucous membrane of the gut,
attaching themselves to the base of the villi, sucking these in; and
when these are destroyed they attack further the submucosa. As
a rule the worms have no blood in the gut, but in their attack on
the submucosa a blood-vessel may be eroded, and so the gut of the
worm filled with blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="451"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;The eggs are oval with broadly rounded poles,
56&nbsp;Âµ to 61&nbsp;Âµ by 34&nbsp;Âµ to 38&nbsp;Âµ. In <i>fresh</i> fÃ¦ces they contain four
granular nucleated segmentation masses of the ovum (fig.&nbsp;329)
separated by a clear space from the shell.</p>

<p><i>Egg of Ancylostome</i> appears to have a single contour. Under high
powers this appears double, but they are the outer and inner surface
of the true (chitinous) egg-shell. Internal to this is the extremely
delicate yolk-envelope, a kind of skin secreted by the egg cell around
itself for protection. The function of this is probably to absorb
water to swell and burst the outer chitinous shell. The embryos
when hatched are termed larvÃ¦.</p>

<p><i>Embryos</i> which are ready to hatch have their bodies almost free
from granules; others, though apparently mature, that have granules
will not hatch.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></p>

</div>

<p><i>Larva.</i>&mdash;<i>Stage I</i>: Average length, 25&nbsp;mm. Maximum thickness
in Åsophageal region, 17&nbsp;Âµ. Head end fairly blunt, from behind the
anus (the tail) tapering in an uniform manner. Buccal cavity is
characteristic, 10&nbsp;Âµ to 12&nbsp;Âµ by 1&nbsp;Âµ to 8&nbsp;Âµ, longer and narrower than the
corresponding larvÃ¦ of <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i>. Åsophagus ârhabditicâ
in character, <i>i.e.</i>, it has three sections, but they are not so clearly
marked off as in larvÃ¦ of the genus Rhabditis. The posterior bulb has
a <b>Y</b>-shaped valve, the function of which, according to Looss, is to
prevent regurgitation of food. The granules of the gut serve as a
reserve of food, and are used up if the larvÃ¦ are starved. The <i>genital
rudiment</i> consists of two cells half-way between the end of the<span class="pagenum" title="452"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a></span>
Åsophagus and the anus in the mid-ventral line. The larva lives
on fÃ¦cal matter and grows to about 0Â·4&nbsp;mm., then moult<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> I takes
place in two days or more, the skin being ruptured by the activity of
the larva.</p>

<p><i>Stage II</i>: The larva is now in this stage, which does not differ
much from the previous one. It grows to 0Â·5&nbsp;mm. The mouth
opening closes. The Åsophagus elongates, becoming cylindrical or
âfilariformâ; a new skin is formed underneath the old one, and in
about a week moult II takes place.</p>

<p><i>Stage III</i>: The <i>mature larva</i> remains enclosed in the old skin.
Its movements are now much more active and of a boring character.
Length is now 0Â·6&nbsp;mm. This mature stage has been erroneously
called the encysted larva, because there is no cyst <i>secreted</i> from its<span class="pagenum" title="453"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453"></a></span>
surface by the larva, but it is simply the old skin, which is not cast off,
but is retained for purposes of protection, as the larva is free living,
but casts it as soon as it assumes parasitic life again. From the egg
to this mature stage is thus six to ten days.</p>

<p><i>Bionomics of Development.</i>&mdash;<i>Air</i>: Eggs can develop when shut
off from the air for a âcomparatively longâ time.</p>

<p><i>Temperature</i>: Hatching takes from eight hours upwards. Eggs
develop best at 25Â° to 30Â°&nbsp;C., but will not develop below 8Â° to 10Â°&nbsp;C.
The larvÃ¦, however, will stand freezing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="454"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Moisture</i>: Eggs and larvÃ¦ do not live long under water, because
they suffocate or starve, but <i>mature</i> larvÃ¦ will live for months (six to
twelve) in water; they require no food&mdash;in fact, can take none in&mdash;but
live on their reserve granules, and in course of time become as
clear as glass.</p>

<p><i>Thigmotropism</i>: The mature larvÃ¦, after casting their skin, will
penetrate pith, climb up stems, stalks, etc., and creep into any pore.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize that this third stage of the <i>mature
larva</i> is the only infective one.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Entry into the Body.</i>&mdash;Infection is effected through the
mouth (Leichtenstern and others), and also through the skin, as was
first discovered by Looss and afterwards confirmed from the most
diverse quarters, partly in the case of <i>Ancylostoma duodenale</i>,
partly in that of <i>A. caninum</i> in dog, man, and monkey. The
larvÃ¦ that gain access to the intestine partly through contaminated
food, or through unwashed hands, or under some circumstances
through water, first throw off their âsheathâ&mdash;that is, they complete
moult II. Moult III takes place four to five days after they have
reached the gut, and they now have a mouth capsule supplied with
four small teeth arranged crosswise, enabling them to fasten on to
the intestinal epithelium, upon which they feed. On this food the
worms grow in four to six days to 3 to 5&nbsp;mm. in length, and now
moult IV. takes place, thus attaining their definite shape and
distinctive character. About eight days later the sexual organs
commence to function; at this time the first copulation should be
taking place&mdash;it will later be frequently repeated&mdash;and a few days
later the first ova are laid, first in less and later in larger numbers, so
that they appear in the fÃ¦ces about four to five weeks after the
infection.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></p>

<p><i>Infection by the Skin.</i>&mdash;Mature larvÃ¦, which are placed on the
skin of man or suitable animals, cast their âsheathâ and bore their
way through delicate fissures either horizontal in the superficial
scales of the epidermis, or through vertical fissures into hair follicles
where these exist, and then they invade the cutis. Now according
as they migrate further into the lymphatic vessels or the small vesicles,
the final path to the gut differs to some extent. The blood path
leads to the right heart, and from there into the lungs; here the
larvÃ¦ leave the blood stream and enter the air passages, over the
mucosa of which they travel further headwards, through the bronchi
into the trachea and larynx, and from hence through the Åsophagus
to the stomach; in some cases also they are swallowed. The<span class="pagenum" title="455"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a></span>
lymphatic path leads finally also into the blood stream, but the
lymphatic glands must first be passed, and in these many larvÃ¦ are
retained and perish. In the cutaneous infection seven to ten weeks
elapse till the time of appearance of the first ova in the fÃ¦ces.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The penetration of the skin by the larvÃ¦ also in man causes reddening and
burning at the affected points, and this is followed in a few days by transitory swelling
in the subcutaneous connective tissue. Skin affections can also be set up by
such Ancylostoma (and Strongyloides) larvÃ¦ as do not gain access to the blood or
lymphatic vessels or gut; such larvÃ¦ apparently wander further in the connective
tissue, and, as Looss has in his own person observed, gain access to the cutis at
different points, thus causing progressive swellings (accompanied by intense itching),
which cease when the worm again penetrates into the deep tissues. Skin affections
such as âground-itchâ or âpani-ghaoâ occurring in the tropics and only attacking
the feet, or other affections (<i>e.g.</i>, sump bunches) are now well recognized as being
due to the invasion of Ancylostoma larvÃ¦.</p>

<p>Other names for these skin affections are water-sore, sore feet of coolies, maza-morra,
bunches, botches, quaddeln, krÃ¤tze, ampoules, gourmes, taons, pitirr.
Whether oral or dermal infection is the more important one further observation
must decide.</p></div>

<p>The duration of life of <i>Ancylostoma duodenale</i>, which is a specific
parasite of man and has not been observed in other mammals,
amounts to about five years, as strayed larvÃ¦ according to Looss
wander for this extent of time in the body.</p>

<p><i>Cultivation of LarvÃ¦.</i>&mdash;(1) Mix the fÃ¦ces (free from drugs such as
salines or thymol) with animal charcoal, adding water if necessary
till a consistence of porridge is obtained. If the stools are very fluid,
allow to sediment first and pour off the fluid. The best charcoal is
that made from bones, and should not have an acid reaction. Charcoal
is necessary in order to prevent fermentation, which kills the
larvÃ¦. Spread in layers 2 to 3&nbsp;mm. thick in Petri dishes. Incubate
at room temperature. To extract the larvÃ¦ from the culture allow
the surface thoroughly to dry, then pour on water; the larvÃ¦
wander out and are poured off and subsequently further purified by
sedimentation or filtering through blotting paper, the larvÃ¦ passing
through.</p>

<p>(2) A funnel is plugged with cotton wool, then filled with washed
sand to within a centimetre or two of the rim. Stand this in a jar of
water so that the level of the water is slightly below that of the sand.
On the surface of the wet sand now place layers of blotting paper,
and spread the fÃ¦ces, diluted if necessary, on this in layers of a few
millimetres thick (<i>vide</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_474">474</a>).</p>

<p><i>Dermal Infection of Dogs.</i>&mdash;Infection with larvÃ¦ of <i>A. caninum</i>.
In two hours most of the larvÃ¦ are free in the cutis and in four hours
in the subcutaneous tissue. By scraping a few days later the mucosa
of the trachea large numbers of larvÃ¦ are found there.</p>

There are no teeth anteriorly on the ventral side of the capsule, but
instead there are two cutting chitinous plates, the anterior portions
of which are prominent and angular, and meet in the middle line
in front. Posteriorly on each side the plate projects less, while
between the anterior and posterior parts there is a deep angle. The
inner (posterior) ventral lancets which also occur in <i>A. duodenale</i> are
large, and project far into the lumen, the tips of these, of the lateral
lancets, and of the dorsal cone almost meeting in the centre of the

are also lateral lancets which start from the base of the dorsal cone.

</div>

<p>The ova are elliptical with a thick (4&nbsp;Âµ) transparent shell (fig.&nbsp;342)
and an external albuminous coating which forms protuberances; the
ova measure 50&nbsp;Âµ to 70&nbsp;Âµ in length, 40&nbsp;Âµ to 50&nbsp;Âµ in breadth; they are
deposited <i>before</i> segmentation; the albuminous coating is stained
yellow by the colouring matter of the fÃ¦ces, but is sometimes absent.
The egg cell is unsegmented, it almost completely fills the shell, and
its nucleus is concealed by the large amount of coarse yolk granules.</p>

<p>Abnormal or unfertilized eggs also occur in fÃ¦ces. They are
distinguished by their elongated form (80&nbsp;Âµ by 45&nbsp;Âµ), irregularly
cylindrical, its contents consisting of refractive granules.</p>

<p><i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> is one of the most frequent parasites of man;
it is distributed all over the inhabited parts of the world, and though
it is particularly frequent in the warmer regions, yet it also occurs<span class="pagenum" title="464"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"></a></span>
in Finland, Greenland, etc. In temperate climates <i>A. lumbricoides</i>
occurs most frequently in young children; it is, moreover, more
common amongst country dwellers than amongst the inhabitants of
towns, but is not lacking in infants, adults and aged persons. As a
rule only a few specimens are present in the intestine, but many cases
are known in temperate zones in which several hundreds of worms
have been found in the same patient. This species is particularly
numerous in the negroes of Africa and America. It occurs also in
the monkey, dog and pig (? <i>A. suilla</i>).</p>

<p>The parasite was known in ancient times; the Greeks called
it á¼Î»Î¼Î¹Î½Ï ÏÏÏÎ¿Î³Î³á½»Î»Î·, Plinius termed it <i>Tinea rotunda</i>, later on
it was named <i>Lumbricus teres</i>. The á¼ÏÎºÎ±ÏÎ¹Ï of the Greeks is our
Oxyuris.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The small intestine is the normal habitat of <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>; the worms,
however, often leave this part of the intestine and wander into the stomach, whence
they are frequently evacuated by vomiting, or they may creep through the Åsophagus
into the pharynx and crawl out through the nose or mouth; very rarely they
may find their way into the Eustachian tube or into the naso-lachrymal duct, or into
the excretory ducts of the liver and pancreas; exceptionally they may gain the
trachea, and they have also been found in the abdominal cavity. They may bore
through adhesions between the intestinal wall and the omentum (worm abscess);
they occasionally penetrate the urinary apparatus and are passed with the urine;
in febrile diseases <i>A. lumbricoides</i> usually leaves the intestine spontaneously. It is
obvious that these wanderings may be accompanied by the most serious symptoms,
but in sensitive persons the invasion of even only a few intestinal Ascarides gives
rise to a series of almost inexplicable symptoms (hysterical, epileptiform attacks,
cerebral congestion, aphonia, etc.), which cease with the expulsion of the worms, so
that many authors are driven to the conclusion that these Ascarides secrete a toxin.
Fortunately, the presence of <i>A. lumbricoides</i> in the intestine is easily demonstrated
by the microscopical examination of the fÃ¦ces.</p></div>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;Several authors (Gros, Schubart, Richter, Leuckart
and Davaine) have demonstrated that the ova of Ascaris develop
in water or moist earth after a long period of incubation. Freezing
and desiccation (if not too long) do not injure their powers of
development; the duration of the development depends on the
degree of the surrounding temperature. At a medium temperature,
after a varying period of incubation, it takes from thirty to forty
days for the embryo to become formed. The spirally rolled up
embryo, with its so-called âtooth,â formed by three papillÃ¦ close
together, never leaves the egg-shell in the open, even if the eggs are
kept for years under favourable conditions. Davaine proved that the
larvÃ¦ hatch out in the intestine of the rat, but are again expelled with
the fÃ¦ces; he therefore concluded that the hatching likewise takes
place within the intestine of man, but is followed by the invasion
of the larvÃ¦. In the meantime Leuckart had sought to infect himself
by swallowing embryo-containing eggs, but without results; he<span class="pagenum" title="465"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465"></a></span>
therefore conjectured that there must be an intermediary host, and
v. Linstow thought he had found it in myriapods (<i>Julus guttulatus</i>).
Subsequently, Davaineâs opinion proved correct. First of all Grassi
succeeded in infecting himself by swallowing 100 embryo-containing
eggs of <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>; five weeks after ingestion the worms had
attained maturity and their ova appeared in the fÃ¦ces. Calandruccio
also sought to infect himself, but failed, yet he succeeded in infecting
a little boy aged 7. Lutz also reports a successful experiment which
must have been positive, as young worms 5Â·5 to 18&nbsp;mm. long were
expelled. Lutz proved that the eggs lost their albuminous shell by
long lying in water and then died when introduced into the stomach;
this would explain the failure of Leuckartâs experiment; in moist earth
the albuminous shell is retained. Finally, Epstein conducted unimpeachable
experiments on three children which place direct infection
with embryo-containing eggs beyond doubt; he, moreover,
proved that the development of the eggs takes place more rapidly in
the fÃ¦ces when there is free admission of air, sun, and a sufficiency
of moisture.</p>

<p>Accordingly, infection occurs partly through water, but principally
direct from the soil.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&mdash;Adults in large intestine of man. Young forms in small
intestine and often in the appendix.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The worm lives in the lower part of the small intestine, cÃ¦cum and vermiform
appendix, and before becoming adult undergoes two or three moults (Heller).
According to Wagener the worms at times live in the gut wall, giving rise to calcareous
nodules. When the uterus of the fertilized females begins to fill with eggs they leave
the cÃ¦cum and travel through the colon to the rectum. The uterus is now packed
with eggs which contain a tadpole-shaped embryo. Egg-laying now takes place,
partly in the rectum, partly outside, the mode of exit being not only passive through
defecation but also an active one on the part of the worms when the patient is in bed.
In this case the worms crawl out of the anus, producing a most intolerable itching as
they scatter their eggs between the nates and the perinÃ¦um. From here in the case
of girls they may get occasionally into the vulva and vagina, and even into the
oviducts and so into the body cavity. The worms also may wander through the
alimentary canal in the opposite direction, getting out occasionally through the
mouth. Recently a <i>rÃ´le</i> has been assigned to them, as to other gut parasites, in
appendicitis and typhlitis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="468"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468"></a></span></p>

<p>It is stated that the males die after fertilizing the females, thus explaining why
they are so rarely met with in fÃ¦ces [but it is probable that they often escape notice
from their small size.&mdash;J.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;S.].</p></div>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;The eggs, which often adhere together, contain a
tadpole-like embryo, the thin tail of which is bent upwards ventrally;
the embryo in a short time, given a sufficiently high temperature, passes
into a second folded nematode-like embryonal stage, lying in the egg-shell,
either in the fÃ¦ces, with which also numerous females pass out,
or in the moisture of the groove between the buttocks, and they there
await the opportunity of being reintroduced into man <i>per os</i>. It is<span class="pagenum" title="469"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469"></a></span>
very improbable that infection takes place directly in the large intestine,
as is occasionally stated, because although the harbourers of Oxyuris
are frequently liable to auto-infection, this takes place exclusively
through the mouth, and is conveyed by the fingers, on which the ova
of Oxyuris, and occasionally the female worms, have clung.</p>

<p>The opportunity for this is afforded every evening, as naturally the troublesome
itching caused by the wandering of the worms is met by scratching and rubbing with
the fingers. It is therefore possible that the eggs may even thus be introduced into
the nose, where the young Oxyuris are perhaps hatched out, if they get high enough
up on the moist pituitary mucous membrane. As a matter of fact, the larvÃ¦ of
Oxyuris have been found in the nose. Moreover, one can understand that the eggs
of Oxyuris are transferred from person to person by the hand, directly or indirectly.
This again explains the wholesale infections which occur in collective dwellings,
after a person harbouring Oxyuris has been admitted into boarding-houses, etc.
The primary infection may be also caused in other ways&mdash;by foods, fruits, vegetables
and other articles that are eaten raw, and are polluted with the ova. Perhaps also
flies or their excrement play a part in the distribution of the parasite, similar to that
demonstrated by Grassi as taking place in the spread of the ova of Trichocephalus
and TÃ¦nia.</p></div>

<p>The assumption of a <i>direct development</i> without an intermediary
host was first substantiated by Leuckart by experiments on himself
and three of his students; about fourteen days after swallowing the
eggs the Oxyuris has attained 6 to 7&nbsp;mm. in length; Grassi, and
later on Calandruccio, infected themselves by swallowing adult female
Oxyuris, with the same results. Heller found worms in the gut
(appendix vermiformis) of a male child five weeks old.</p>

<h5>TECHNIQUE.</h5>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Preservation and Examination of Flukes.</span></p>


<p><i>Fixation.</i>&mdash;(Method <span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>.) (1) Place the flukes in a test tube or small bottle
a quarter full of normal saline. Shake the contents <i>as hard as possible</i> (the
object of this is to <i>extend</i> the flukes) for half a minute.</p>

<p>(2) Add <i>immediately</i> an equal bulk of saturated aqueous solution of corrosive
sublimate and shake again as vigorously as possible for a few minutes.</p>

<p>(3) Transfer when convenient to 70 per cent. alcohol. (Before staining
and mounting remove the sublimate with tincture of iodine.)</p>

<p>(Method <span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>.) In case of large flukes, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Fasciola hepatica</i>, <i>Fasciolopsis
buski</i>, compress the flukes between two glass slides with rubber bands or
thread. Fix in sublimate or in absolute alcohol, or in 10 per cent. formalin.</p>

<p>(Method <span class="lowercase smcap">C</span>.) Place the flukes in 10 per cent. formalin solution.</p>

<p><i>Staining</i> is successfully effected by using quite <i>dilute</i> solutions of carmine
or hÃ¦matein overnight. This is far preferable to using strong solutions,
as it may be almost impossible to remove a too intense stain. Almost any
dilute carmine solution suffices. One of the best is acetic-alum carmine
(boil excess of carmine in a saturated aqueous solution of potash-alum for
about fifteen minutes; add glacial acetic acid to the extent of 10 per cent.;
let it stand for a week; filter). For use, dilute about thirty times with
water. Place the flukes directly in the stain. Stain overnight or longer.</p>

<p><i>Differentiation.</i>&mdash;In order to get the sharpest picture, it is best now to
differentiate (but this may often be omitted) with acid alcohol (70 per cent.
alcohol 100 parts, HCl 5 drops). Allow to act from one to twenty-four
hours, according to the appearance of the flukes. Similarly, in staining with
<i>hÃ¦matoxylin</i> solution, dilute twenty to thirty times so that the water is merely
tinged with the stain. Differentiate as before. After staining, dehydrate,
clear, and mount in balsam if required.</p>

<p><i>Clearing and Mounting.</i>&mdash;(1) <i>Carbolic acid</i> (carbolic acid 94, water 6) is
a very convenient clearing agent. It may be used for stained or unstained
specimens. It will clear rapidly without previous dehydration. If it is
required to mount a specimen permanently, transfer from carbolic to
alcohol, then cedar-wood oil (or xylol, etc.), then balsam.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Creasote.</i>&mdash;Dehydrate the specimen, stained or unstained, transfer to
creasote. If it is desired to mount permanently, transfer back to alcohol,
then cedar-wood oil, then balsam.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Cedar-wood Oil.</i>&mdash;Preferable to xylol or oil of cloves. Dehydrate
the specimen in alcohol. To mount permanently, transfer to balsam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="472"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472"></a></span></p>

<p>(4) <i>Glycerine.</i>&mdash;<i>Vide</i> under methods of preservation of ova; to mount
permanently, transfer to glycerine jelly; subsequently to harden the jelly,
expose to formalin vapour.</p>

<p>Of these media, carbolic acid has the greatest refractive index excepting
that of balsam. The latter may, in some cases, render structures too
transparent, and it may be advisable to use only glycerine or glycerine jelly.</p>


<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Preservation of Ova in FÃ¦ces, Urine, Bile, etc.</span></p>

<p>Heat some 70 per cent. alcohol in a basin to about 60 to 70Â°&nbsp;C. (until
bubbles begin to appear). Add the fÃ¦ces, etc., in the proportion of one
part to about nine of fixative; keep stirring. Allow the sediment to settle.
Transfer to a bottle with some fresh 70 per cent. alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Transference to Glycerine.</i>&mdash;Prepare 5 per cent., 10 per cent., 20 per cent.
solutions of glycerine in 70 per cent. alcohol. Pour off the alcohol in the
bottle of fÃ¦ces, etc., and replace by 5 per cent. glycerine solution. Allow
to stand an hour or so. Then in the same way replace the 5 per cent. by
a 10 per cent. glycerine, and finally by a 20 per cent. glycerine solution.
When in this latter expose freely to the air (protecting from dust), so
as to allow the alcohol and water to evaporate. Add a few drops of
glycerine from time to time till eventually the ova are in pure glycerine.
(In a very moist climate it may be necessary to use lime or calcium
chloride to dry the air.) To mount permanently transfer some of the
sediment to glycerine jelly.</p>


<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Preservation and Examination of Cestodes.</span></p>

<p><i>Fixation.</i>&mdash;(1) <i>Saturated aqueous corrosive sublimate.</i>&mdash;Add to this glacial
acetic acid to the extent of 1 per cent. (Note this fixative will dissolve
the âcalcareous corpusclesâ; 10 grammes of sublimate to 160&nbsp;c.c. of
water will give a saturated solution.) Warm the fixative to 70Â° to 80Â°&nbsp;C.
(Avoid the use of needles.) Use plenty of fixative. Allow to act for a
quarter of an hour or so. (<i>a</i>) Transfer to 70 per cent. alcohol. (It is
advisable to remove the sublimate by the use of Lugolâs solution, or a
solution containing tincture of iodine, adding this until the iodine colour
is permanent.) Or (<i>b</i>) transfer for preservation to 10 per cent. formalin.</p>

<p>Or (2) 10 <i>per cent. formalin</i>.&mdash;In order to prevent contraction it is
advisable to extend the tapeworm and keep it fixed by glass plates, or
wind the worm around a wide glass tube or bottle, and then fix it.</p>

<p>Or (3) <i>fix in hot alcohol</i>.</p>

<p><i>Staining.</i>&mdash;As under flukes. It is necessary to sacrifice portions of the
tapeworm for this purpose, cutting out, <i>e.g.</i>, mature segments, so as to
study the topography of the genitalia.</p>

<p><i>Clearing.</i>&mdash;As under flukes. To examine the hooks satisfactorily it is
best to cut off the head with a sharp knife and mount. A certain amount
of pressure is then advisable in order to view the hooks completely so as
to measure them.</p>

<p>As under flukes.</p>


<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Preservation and Examination of Nematodes.</span></p>

<p><i>Fixation.</i>&mdash;(1) Thoroughly wash the worms to get rid of mucus, etc., by
shaking up in warm saline (or water) till the washings are clean. Then
transfer to 70 per cent. alcohol <i>heated</i> to about 70Â°&nbsp;C. It is absolutely
necessary to use <i>hot</i> fixatives in order to <i>extend</i> the worms. If no alcohol
or spirit is immediately available, drop the worms into <i>hot</i> water, or saline,
and transfer later to 70 per cent. alcohol.</p>

<p>(2) Drop into hot 10 per cent. formalin.</p>

<p><i>Clearing.</i>&mdash;(1) Carbolic acid, <i>vide</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_471">471</a>.</p>

<p>(2) Creasote, <i>vide</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_471">471</a>.</p>

<p>(3) Glycerine, <i>vide</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_472">472</a>.</p>

<p><i>Staining.</i>&mdash;In case of quite small Nematodes, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>AnguillulidÃ¦</i>, carmine
may be used, but as a rule staining is not advantageous.</p>

<p><i>Rolling.</i>&mdash;In order to study the mouth parts, or bursa, etc., it is necessary
to place the worm in any desired position. This is done as one would
roll a penholder along the table by oneâs finger placed on top of it. In the
case of a worm, one edge of the cover-glass is placed over the worm, the
other is supported by a strip of cardboard. By tapping the cover-glass
the worm will now revolve as much as required provided it is <i>round</i> and
<i>straight</i>. In certain cases it may be necessary for this purpose to cut off
the head or tail. Roll these separately.</p>

<p>When a suitable position is got, the worm may be fixed in this position
by pressure on the cover-glass, so as slightly to flatten it.</p>

<p><i>Mounting the Head.</i>&mdash;If it is required to get an end view, it is necessary to
cut off the head transversely as near the end as possible, and then mount.</p>

<p><i>Detection of Eggs</i> (Bass and Hall).&mdash;Mix the fÃ¦ces thoroughly with ten
times the volume of water. Filter through gauze. Centrifugalize the
filtrate. Wash the sediment and centrifugalize. Repeat twice. To sediment
add CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution, sp. gr. 1250. The eggs float to surface. Pour
off surface fluid. Dilute to sp. gr. 1050. Centrifugalize. Examine sediment,
which contains practically all the eggs in the stool.</p>

<p><i>Detection of Small Nematodes.</i>&mdash;Mix the fÃ¦ces thoroughly with water.
Allow to settle for five minutes. Carefully decant off, or better, syphon off
the fluid. Mix the sediment again with water. Allow to settle. Remove
the fluid. Repeat several times. Examine the sediment in a Petri dish.
As the fluid is poured off, the worms will be seen collected in the backwater.
Remove them with a brush. Fix in hot 70 per cent. alcohol.</p>

<p>A modification of the second method of Looss (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_455">455</a>) is that of

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Gutless, nematode-like worms that carry at their anterior end a retractile
rostrum beset with hooks. In their adult condition they only live in vertebrate
animals. During their larval stage they are often parasitic in invertebrate animals.</p>

<p>The <i>Acanthocephala</i> are elongated cylindrical worms, with a rounded posterior
end. In some species an annulation is distinctly recognizable; they are, however,
not segmented. The size varies according to the species, between about 5 to 10&nbsp;mm.
and 40 to 50&nbsp;cm.; in general, however, there is a preponderance of the small species.
The sexes are separate, and the males can easily be distinguished from the females
without examination of the genitalia, as the females are both larger and thicker.</p>

<p>The body wall of Echinorhynchus is limited by a thin cuticle, which is attached
inwardly to the hypodermis. In only exceptional cases a syncytium with large
nuclei, even in the adult condition, is represented by the hypodermis; and in it fibre
systems, the elements of which run in layers in various directions, appear, and it is
only towards the interior from these strata of fibres that the nuclei of the hypodermis
are found. As a rule, these fibres, at all events the radiary fibres, are regarded as
muscles. Hamann describes them as elastic fibres, which lie in a viscid gelatinous
connective substance (transformed protoplasm?); a lacune system filled with a
granular fluid, the central part of which are two longitudinal lacunes lying at the
sides, also belongs to the cutaneous strata, as do the so-called lemnisci, two short,
flat organs suspended in the body cavity, and the pedicles of which are attached
anteriorly at the border between the rostrum and body; their structure as well as
their origin permit them to be traced to the skin (fig.&nbsp;348<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>).</p>

<p>Finally, inwardly below the skin there follows a layer of annular, and after these
a layer of longitudinal muscles, the structure cells of which remain present in the
residues, carrying nuclei. The motor apparatus of the rostrum, the sheath of the
rostrum, and the lemnisci also belong to the muscular system. The rostrum
represents a finger-shaped hollow process of the cutaneous layer; but, according
to Hamann, it originates from the entoderm and passes through the skin secondarily.
It is covered by a thin cuticle, and as a rule contains a large number of regularly
placed chitinous hooks that adjoin a granular formation tissue. From the base of
the rostrum springs a tubular hollow muscle extending into the body cavity; this
is the <span class="lowercase smcap">RECEPTACULUM PROBOSCIDIS</span>, from the base of which again bundles of
longitudinal muscles originate, which pass along its axis and that of the rostrum
itself, and are inserted at the inner surface of its anterior end (<span class="lowercase smcap">RETRACTOR
PROBOSCIDIS</span>). These muscles when they contract invaginate the proboscis and
draw it into the receptaculum; when reversed they act again as <span class="lowercase smcap">PROTRUSOR
PROBOSCIDIS</span>. The whole of the anterior body, however, can be invaginated, and
for this purpose there is a muscle that originates from the body wall at a variable
distance back, and which is joined to the receptaculum (<span class="lowercase smcap">RETRACTOR RECEPTACULI</span>);
there is also a bell-shaped muscle which springs from the body wall behind the
lemnisci in rings, and passes forward to the spot of attachment of the lemnisci.</p>

<p>The nervous system consists of a cluster of ganglia situated at the base of the
rostrum, from which three nerves pass towards the front and two towards the back.
No sensory organs are known.</p>

<p>The excretory organs, according to Kaiser, lie at the upper border of the ductus
ejaculatorius in the male and at the so-called bell in the female. Here they<span class="pagenum" title="476"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476"></a></span>
represent the long-known villous tufts, placed on disc-like cushions. In each of the
cylindrical villi&mdash;which terminate blindly towards the body cavity&mdash;there lies a
cilium, which springs from the membrane lining the villus, and which lies in a space
cavity of the villus, which ultimately proceeds as a
little canal. There are three canals discharging into
the uterus that serve to conduct the excretory materials
from the body cavity; special glandular cells corresponding
to the terminal cells of the Platyhelminths,
at the commencement of the system, are not present
in the Acanthocephala.</p></div>


<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Sexual Organs.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Male Organs.</i>&mdash;The greatest part of the male
genital apparatus is contained in a muscular sheath&mdash;the
ligament&mdash;which originates at the posterior end
of the receptaculum proboscidis, passes along longitudinally
through the body cavity, and is inserted at
the posterior end of the worm. The two oval testicles
usually lie one behind the other; their vasa efferentia
unite sooner or later into a vas deferens which passes
backwards, and finally terminates in the penis; the
terminal portion of the conducting apparatus is surrounded
by six large glandular cells (prostatic glands)
the excretory ducts of which open into the vas deferens. The penis itself is placed
at the base of a bell-shaped invagination of the posterior end, the bursa, which is
everted during copulation.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Female Organs.</i>&mdash;There are only two ovaries present in the ligament during
the larval stage. During the course of growth they divide into accumulations of
cells (placentulÃ¦, loose or floating ovaries), which finally cause the ligament to burst<span class="pagenum" title="477"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477"></a></span>
and they thus attain the body cavity. Thence a peculiarly constructed apparatus
finally conveys the eggs out. This apparatus consists of the uterine bell and vagina,
the latter discharging at the posterior extremity of the body. The bell is a muscular
canal provided with apertures at both the anterior and posterior extremities. Its
interior space is in direct communication with the body cavity, and the anterior
orifice takes up all materials floating in the cavity&mdash;egg-balls, mature and immature
eggs&mdash;and pushes these further backwards. The continuation of the bell lumen is
now narrowed by a number of large cells in such a manner that only bodies of a
certain form can pass through this tract and attain the uterus; everything else is
conveyed back into the body cavity through the posterior opening of the bell.</p>

<p>The eggs are already fertilized in the body cavity, and in this position go through
their development to the formation of the embryo. Completely developed eggs are
surrounded by three shells, and are generally fusiform. The eggs agglomerate
in masses in the uterus until they are finally deposited through the vagina and vulva.
For the further development, the transmission of the eggs into an intermediary host&mdash;usually
a crustacean or an insect&mdash;is necessary; the metamorphosis is very complicated;
but this transmission may be very easily effected artificially by feeding suitable
crustaceans (<i>Asellus</i>, <i>Gammarus</i>, etc.) with the eggs of <i>Acanthocephala</i>; this being
the only method of inducing the larva to hatch out so that its structure may be
studied. The larva appears in the form of an elongated, somewhat bent body, at the
stumpy anterior end of which there is a crown of hooks or spines, whereas the
posterior end is pointed. Especial retractors draw in the hook-beset anterior surface,
and an elastic cushion beneath them jerks them forward again when required. In
the middle of the body a roundish heap of small cells is seen, from which the entire
body of the Echinorhynchus originates, even to the cutaneous layer; the latter is
also the larval skin in which the small Echinorhynchus gradually grows. The
development of all the organs takes place within the intermediary host, and the
parasite only needs to be imported into the terminal host to attain the adult stage after
a certain growth. In some cases, however, a second intermediary host is utilized.</p>

<p>Species of <i>Acanthocephala</i> only occur exceptionally in human beings.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The body is elongated, gradually decreasing in thickness towards the back.
The rostrum is almost spherical, and is beset with five or six rows of recurved
hooks. The males measure 10 to 15&nbsp;cm. in length, the females 30 to 50&nbsp;cm.;
the eggs are provided with three shells, of which the middle one is the thickest.
The eggs measure 0Â·08 to 0.1&nbsp;mm. in length. The <span class="smcap">giant
Echinorhynchus</span> occurs especially in the intestinal canal
of the domestic pig; it is less common in other mammals.
It bores deep into the mucous membrane with its rostrum,
and causes an annular proliferation around the perforated
spot; occasionally also it causes perforation of the intestine.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether the giant Echinorhynchus occurs
in man. Leuckart admitted that there were a few positive
cases. According to Lindemann, <i>Ech. gigas</i> occurs in
human beings in South Russia, and its presence is not rare.
This statement, however, has not been confirmed. Its
presence in man is by no means impossible, as its intermediary
host, the cankerworm, or cock-chafer (<i>Melolontha</i>),

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Very long thin worms similar to FilariÃ¦, which, in their adult condition, live
free in brooks, pools and springs; the mouth and the commencement of the
intestine are obliterated; there are no lateral ridges, and the muscular system
presents a structure different to that of the <i>Nematoda</i>. The posterior end of the
male is split, and spicules are lacking; there are two testicles. In both sexes the
genitalia discharge through the terminal gut.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦, which carry a rostrum beset with hooks, force themselves into the
larvÃ¦ of water-insects; more rarely they invade molluscs, and they then become
encysted within the body of the host. According to Villot, at least a part of them
attain the intestine of fishes, where they again become encysted, and after a period
of rest they travel into the tissues of their hosts, and finally again reach the exterior
by way of the intestine, where they then become adult. In most cases, however,
the gordius larvÃ¦ are taken up by predacious water insects; they live for a while
in the body cavity of these insects, undergo a metamorphosis, and finally wander

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <i>Hirudinea</i>, which have been appropriately included amongst the Annelida,
differ in many respects from the typical members of the group; their body is long
and flat, it lacks the parapodia that are characteristic to all forms of Annelida; but,
on the other hand, possesses a terminal posterior sucker, and in many species there
is also an anterior sucker. The mouth is terminal at the anterior end, the anus lies
dorsally above the posterior sucker (fig.&nbsp;348<span class="lowercase smcap">D</span>). The body is
segmented, but this is less manifest in the body covering than
it is in the arrangement of the internal organs; the segmentation,
nevertheless, is also indicated exteriorly by the appearance
of the cutaneous sensory organs which correspond to the
segments. This shows what the condition of the ganglia in the
abdominal ganglion chain has taught us, that the anterior and
the most posterior segments are considerably abbreviated&mdash;a
part of the latter taking part in the formation of the suctorial
organs. In a great many species the skin is distinctly annulated,
four or five of such rings, at least in the central region
of the body, appearing on one segment of the body. The
condition of their body cavity is another peculiarity of the
<i>Hirudinea</i>; it is narrowed by the powerful development of the
connective tissue and the muscular system into four tubular
sinuses, which have the appearance of blood-vessels. There
are usually one dorsal and one ventral median trunks, as well
as two lateral trunks; in addition, a particular blood-vessel
system exists.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The skin consists of a very thin cuticle that is cast off from
time to time; it is secreted by the underlying cylindrical epithelium,
which contains numerous goblet cells. The muscular
system is strongly developed; it consists of long tubular fibres,
which run circularly, longitudinally and in the dorso-ventral
direction; the muscular system is subject to a particular
expansion in the clinging organs and at the commencement
of the intestine. On the whole, the alimentary canal represents
a tube running straight from the mouth to the anus, which
possesses a number of blind sac-like protuberances at the
sides varying according to the species. The most anterior
section, the pharynx, in the leeches with maxillÃ¦ carries three
chitinous, semicircular plates furnished with teeth&mdash;the jaws&mdash;which
serve to tear up the epidermis in order to open the
blood-vessels; in the leeches with rostra a long protractile
proboscis rises from the base of the elongated pharynx.
Numerous salivary glands, the secretion from which possesses
toxic properties, discharge into the pharynx. The Åsophagus,
which follows the pharynx, and to the exterior of which
numerous radiary muscles are fixed, is a suctorial organ in
its entire structure. The nutriment in the larger species consists
of the blood of vertebrate animals, in smaller species and
in the young stages the food consists of small invertebrate
animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="481"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481"></a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">NERVOUS SYSTEM</span> exhibits the typical structure of other segmented worms;
the sensory organs consist of the previously mentioned goblet-shaped cutaneous
sensory organs, of the organs of taste, and of eyes, the latter frequently being
present in large numbers.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">EXCRETORY</span> or segmental organs exhibit many peculiarities, which cannot,
however, be detailed here. They commence with funnels in the lacunes of the body
cavity, and usually discharge on the ventral surface.</p>

<p>Almost all the <i>Hirudinea</i> are hermaphrodite and copulate reciprocally. The
two ovaries are very small, and the oviducts that proceed from them soon unite into
a common duct, which then passes into the uterus and discharges through the
short vagina in the median line of the ventral surface behind the male organs into
the so-called clitellar region. The male sexual apparatus consists of symmetrically
arranged testicles, varying in number according to the species, the short vasa
efferentia of which, one by one, run into the vas deferens, passing towards the front
on each side. In front, at about the level, or a little in front, of the female genitalia,
the two vessels pass into a convoluted mass of tubes to the so-called epididymis, and
then discharge into the single protractile penis (fig.&nbsp;348<span class="lowercase smcap">D</span>).</p>

<p>All leeches deposit so-called <span class="lowercase smcap">COCOONS</span>. These are small barrel-shaped or pouch-like
bodies, which are surrounded by a thicker shell and contain a number of eggs
in a large mass of albumen; the albumen originates from glands of the generative
organs, the shell substance from cutaneous glands of the clitellar region.</p></div>


<p class="spec">Family. <b>GnathobdellidÃ¦</b> (Leeches with Jaws).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These are distinguished by the possession of usually three jaws in the pharynx;
the body consists of twenty-six segments. The posterior sucker is large and flat;
the anterior sucker is smaller. The <i>Hirudinea</i> have five pairs of eyes, the <i>NephelinÃ¦</i>

lies between the thirtieth and thirty-first rings, the female orifice between the thirty-fifth
and thirty-sixth. There are numerous species, some of which are utilized for
medicinal purposes.</p></div>

<p>It occurs in numerous colour varieties, one of which has been designated

and is marked with six rusty-red longitudinal
stripes. The ventral surface is olive-green, more
or less spotted with black, and marked at the
sides with a black longitudinal line. The length
averages 8 to 12 to 20&nbsp;cm. This leech lives in
swamps, ponds and brooks, overgrown with plants
and having a muddy bed. The cocoons are
deposited in the soil at the sides. Europe, as
well as North Africa, is its home. At the present
day it has been exterminated from most parts of
Central Europe, but it is still very common in
Hungary. Its use for medicinal purposes is well
known. A large leech can suck about 15&nbsp;grs. of
blood, and about the same amount is lost through

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Bilaterally</span> symmetrical segmented animals which are covered with a thick
cuticle that is frequently calcareous (<i>Crustacea</i>), but always thinner between the
segments; they carry (primitively) a pair of jointed appendages on every segment.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a>
The segments of the body are uniform in certain regions, but differ from those of
contiguous regions, so that it is easy to distinguish three parts (head, thorax and
abdomen), each composed of segments. The cephalic segments are always formed
into a uniform head, the segmentation being scarcely recognizable at either end;
the thoracic segments may also fuse, or part or all of them may coalesce with the
head; the abdomen, as a rule, retains its segmentation, but this may possibly also
be lost, in which case it is [sometimes] united to the cephalothorax. The structure
of the three regions depends mostly on the varying form and function of the
appendages: those on the head are primitively locomotive organs (and frequently
are still so in the early stages), but they become transformed into feelers and mouth-parts
(mandibles, maxillÃ¦); the limbs of the thorax, however, usually retain their
ambulatory functions, as frequently do those of the abdomen; sometimes, however,
the abdominal limbs disappear, entirely or partly; in the latter case they are then
utilized for other purposes.</p>

<p>In their organization the <i>Arthropoda</i> approach the segmented worms.</p>

<p>The <i>Arthropoda</i> are generally divided into five groups (<i>Crustacea</i>,<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> <i>Protracheata</i>,
<i>Arachnoidea</i>, <i>Myriapoda</i>,<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> and <i>Insecta</i> or <i>Hexapoda</i>), of which only the <i>Arachnoidea</i>
and the <i>Hexapoda</i> interest us here.</p></div>


<h4><i>A.</i> <b>ARACHNOIDEA</b> (Spiders, Mites, etc.).</h4>

<p>The head and thorax are always united together; the abdomen is
either segmented or without exterior segmentation, in which case it is
united with the cephalothorax.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> The number of pairs of appendages<span class="pagenum" title="484"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484"></a></span>
amount to six, of which the two front pairs, the chelicerÃ¦ and the
pedipalpi, are attached to the head region and the four remaining
pairs to the thoracic region.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> The abdomen in the adult condition
has no appendages. The Arachnoids are air-breathers, and for this
purpose are either provided with tracheÃ¦ or with so-called lung-sacs,
or they breathe through the surface of the body. Some aquatic forms
breathe by gills.</p>

<p>There are eight or ten orders of Arachnoids,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> of which, however,
only two, the <i>Acarina</i> and the <i>Linguatulida</i>, have to be considered

it is only rarely that a faint line indicates the division between a cephalothorax and

and sucking, and vary according to their use. The chelicerÃ¦<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> are fang-like jaws

is reduced to a minimum, eyes are usually lacking. The intestine, situated in the
central part, generally has three blind appendages; the anus is situated on the venter

which six-legged larvÃ¦ hatch. The <i>Acarina</i> live either free in the water or in moist

<p>Leptus occur as parasites in the human skin and cause a cutaneous
disease known as autumn erythema, and produce a very unpleasant
sensation on account of the troublesome
itching; in children it is very
often accompanied by fever.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Formerly these mites were considered
adult forms, but when they were recognized
as mite larvÃ¦ they were taken
for those of the spider-mite (<i>Tetranychus
telarius</i>); the investigations of Hanstein,
however, showed this to be a mistake.
When Henking first investigated the development of <i>Trombidium fuliginosum</i>,
parasitic in the larval stage on vine-fretters, he demonstrated the occurrence of a
form very similar to <i>Leptus autumnalis</i>, and the âautumn, grass, or gooseberryâ
louse was commonly designated the Trombidium larva. Even before Henkingâs
work it had been described by MÃ©gnin as the larva of <i>Trombidium holosericeum</i>, a
red-coloured species, frequently occurring in spring and summer on the ground, trees,
etc. This assumption, however, as Moniez was the first to explain, is not correct;<span class="pagenum" title="486"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486"></a></span>
indeed, as many as three species come under consideration: <i>T. gymnopterosum</i>,
L., <i>T. fuliginosum</i>, Herm. (according to Brucker), and two species known hitherto
only in the early stage, <i>T. striaticeps</i>, Helm. et Oudem., and <i>T. poriceps</i>, Helm. et
Oudem., which are not only parasitic on mammals, but on birds, on Arthropods and
especially on insects. Arthropods appear to be the normal hosts for the larvÃ¦.</p></div>

of their oral apparatus, by preference invading the orifices of the
sebaceous glands so as to suck the blood; around the point attacked
there arises a wheal about the size of a lentil, and around the inserted
hypopharynx a fibrinous secretion, the âproboscis,â which, however,
is a product of the host, just as chitinous secretions are provoked by
Trombidia parasitic on Arthropods.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Further species, analogous in habit to <i>Leptus autumnalis</i>, are described by Riley
from Central and South America as <i>L. americanus</i> and <i>L. irritans</i>.</p></div>

<p>[<i>L. autumnalis</i> attacks small mammals by preference, such as moles
and hares, which are often literally covered with them. Dogs are
also subject to their attack, and cats suffer similarly. This mite also
frequently appears in colonies on cows; cavalry horses after autumn
manÅuvres often suffer from an erythematous affection about the
hocks and knees due to this pest.</p>

<p>[A number of Leptus, so far undescribed, occur abroad which
attack man in the same way as <i>L. autumnalis</i> in Europe. Dr. Durham
has brought me specimens from British Guiana called <i>bÃªte rouge</i>;
this species works under the skin much as does our European species,
but it is very distinct, being considerably larger.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Trombidium tlalsahuate</b>, Lemaire, 1867.</p>

<p><i>T. tlalsahuate</i> occurs in Mexico under conditions similar to those
of Leptus here. It also frequently attacks men, and especially fastens
itself on to the eyelids, in the axillae, navel, or on the prepuce; it
induces itching and swelling of the parts affected, and sometimes
even causes suppuration; the symptoms, however, generally disappear
after a week and remain localized.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<p>Other species of mites which attack man are reported, mostly
by travellers, from various other places; zoologically, however,
there is little known about them. The pou dâagouti in Guiana,
niaibi in New Granada, colorada in Cuba, mouqui in Para, and the

<p class="spec"><b>Akamushi</b> or <b>Kedani</b>.</p>

<p>In a few districts of Japan there occurs a serious illness, with
a mortality of 40 to 70 per cent. It is called river or flood
fever, and the Japanese doctors have connected it with a small
mite (akamushi, kedani). Baelz has opposed this opinion on the
grounds that he has repeatedly observed the same species of mite
in his dwelling without any subsequent illness occurring. According
to KeÃ¯suke Tanaka, however, a connection certainly does exist,
inasmuch as the akamushi, like Leptus, attacks persons to suck
blood. If the mite is not removed, or if the spot attacked is
injured by scratching, etc., a papule surrounded by a red area
forms, and a pustule ensues; and finally a black scab covers the
seat of injury. The lesion becomes the point of entrance of bacteria,
especially a species of <i>proteus</i> which produces river fever. If the

<p>The authors discovered these mites, but always dead, in the urine of a Japanese
suffering from fibrinuria complicated with chyluria and hÃ¦maturia. They surmised
that they were endoparasites, probably situated in the kidney; but this view is not
convincing, though they also report that for a week, day after day, the mites were
found in the patientâs urine, as well as in urine drawn off by means of a catheter,
and in the water used to wash out the bladder (one or two specimens and an egg).
The statement that these mites have large eyes makes the discovery suspicious, to
say the least. The significance of the discovery is not supported by the further
statement that Disse is supposed to have found an encapsuled mite closely related
to the Tyroglyphides on the wall of the vena cava.</p>

are six-legged.</p></div>

<p>[The true ticks (<i>IxodidÃ¦</i>) are all blood-suckers, and as far as is
known they do not take vegetable food at all. Not only are the
<i>IxodidÃ¦</i> important as actual parasites, but they are most so on
account of the fact that they are the active agents in carrying various
diseases in animals and apparently in man. It has been conclusively
proved that the bont tick (<i>Amblyomma hebrÃ¦um</i>) is the carrier
of the fatal âheart-water feverâ so rife amongst sheep in South
Africa, that the dog tick (<i>HÃ¦maphysalis leachi</i>) is the agent by which the
protozoa that cause malignant jaundice in dogs are distributed, that<span class="pagenum" title="494"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494"></a></span>
Texas fever in cattle is spread by <i>Rhipicephalus annulatus</i>, and Coast
or Rhodesian fever by <i>R. appendiculatus</i> and <i>R. simus</i>. Their importance
as disease carriers amongst mammals is therefore considerable,
and it may prove to be so for man.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> They frequently attack
man, but chiefly, according to my observations, in their early stages
in Europe; this is not so, however, abroad. The life-history of
a number of ticks has been clearly demonstrated. Mr. Wheler has
shown that in <i>Ixodes reduvius</i> it is as follows: the female deposits
her eggs in masses upon the ground, gradually reducing in size
as the eggs pass out, until she finally remains a mere shrivelled
empty bag and then dies. The eggs are oval, golden brown in
colour and smooth; in length they are 0Â·59&nbsp;mm.; as in all <i>IxodidÃ¦</i>
they are covered with a glutinous secretion, by means of which
they adhere together in masses. These egg masses may be deposited
anywhere on the ground, but amongst rough, coarse herbage seems
to be the favourite place. The egg stage may last as long as
twenty-two weeks, or it may only take eight weeks. In the case
of the bont tick a single female may deposit 15,000 or more eggs.
The process of egg-laying is described as follows by Mr. Wheler:
âWhen egg-laying is about to take place, the head is further
depressed till it rests close against the under side of the body.
In this attitude the end of the rostrum actually touches the genital
orifice, the palpi being at the same time widely opened out. Behind
the head and from beneath the shield, at what for the purposes
of explanation may be described as the back of the neck, a white,
perfectly transparent, delicate gelatinous membrane is brought down
through inflation, either with air or with a transparent fluid, above
the head, which it temporarily conceals. The end of this membrane
terminates in two conical points which appear to be covered
with a glutinous secretion, and at the same time an ovipositor of a
somewhat similar character, but only semi-transparent, is pushed
forward from the genital orifice. This latter is a tube, within which
is the egg. As the ovipositor projects it turns itself inside out, like
the finger of a glove, leaving the egg protruded at the end and lying
between the two finger-like points of the membrane. The membrane
and the ovipositor are then withdrawn each from the other. The
egg adheres to the former, which collapses through the withdrawal
of its contents, dragging the head forward and depositing it on the
top of the head. Neither legs, palpi, nor the organs of the mouth
take any part in oviposition, but after the collapse of the membrane
the palpi are closed and the head is raised, by which action the
egg is pushed forward to the front edge of the shield, forming<span class="pagenum" title="495"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495"></a></span>
in time an adherent mass of eggs, which are deposited in front of
the tick.â</p>

<p>[The egg gives rise to the larval form, the so-called âseed-tickâ
stage. At first these minute specks are pallid and soft, but they
soon harden and darken in colour. These larvÃ¦ are six-legged and
crawl up grasses and various plants, and there await a passing host,
waving their two front legs in the air and becoming attached by this
means. The larval ticks feed upon the blood of the host, and when
replete fall to the ground, the body becoming inflated in the
meanwhile. These larvÃ¦ may remain on the host only two days, or
they may remain much longer. Eventually they moult on the ground
and change to the nymph or pupal stage, which has four pairs of legs.
This pupa acts just as the larva, crawls up plants and waits to regain
the host. After a time the nymphs, having gorged themselves with
blood, fall off and remain on the ground for nearly three months;
they then moult and become adult males and females. In about ten
days they assume their normal colour and regain the host afresh;
the female gradually swells until she attains that large inflated form
so characteristic of ticks. The male does not swell, but nevertheless
feeds upon the host and fertilizes the female.</p>

<p>[The act of coitus is strange: the male tick inserts its rostrum and
other mouth organs into the sexual orifice of the female, between the
base of the posterior pair of legs. The males then die and the
females fall to the ground and deposit the ova. There are variations
in the different species, of course, from those given above, which
apply solely to <i>Ixodes reduvius</i>. The larvÃ¦ and nymphs seem to
attack most animals, but the adults mainly keep to the same host.
The periods in the life-cycle of ticks not only vary in the different
species, but in each species according to climatic conditions; for
instance, in the bont tick (<i>Amblyomma hebrÃ¦um</i>, Koch), Lounsbury
has shown that the development is rapid in summer, slow in winter.
The period from the time that the female drops to the time she
commences to lay eggs varied in specimens observed by him from
twelve days in summer to twelve weeks in winter, and the complete
period from the dropping of the female to the hatching of the eggs,
from eleven weeks in summer to thirty-six weeks through the winter.
Other stages vary in a similar manner.</p>

<p>[Ticks may live a long time away from the host provided they are
supplied with a certain amount of moisture. Mr. Wheler kept dog
ticks (<i>Ixodes plumbeus</i>) in the larval stage for ten months; the pupÃ¦,
male and female, of <i>I. reduvius</i> for six months.</p>

<p>[I have kept <i>Ornithodorus moubata</i> alive for eighteen months
without food.</p>

<p>[In many species moulting takes place off the host, but in <i>I. bovis</i>,<span class="pagenum" title="496"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496"></a></span>
now known as <i>Rhipicephalus annulatus</i>, Say (the carrier of Texas
fever), moulting takes place on the host, and in many other species
also.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> Some species of ticks leave their host on its death (as the dog
tick, <i>HÃ¦maphysalis leachi</i>), but others die with the host (bont tick,
<i>Amblyomma hebrÃ¦um</i>).</p>

<p>[Two species are of special importance, namely <i>Ornithodorus
moubata</i>, Murray, which may infect human beings with the spirillum
of African tick fever, and <i>Dermatocentor reticulatus</i> var. <i>occidentalis</i>,
which is said to be the carrier of Rocky Mountain spotted fever.</p>


<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Classification of</span> <i>IxodidÃ¦</i>.</p>

<p>[The ticks, or <i>IxodidÃ¦</i>, are divided into two groups, known as
(1) <i>ArgantinÃ¦</i>, (2) <i>IxodinÃ¦</i>. The <i>ArgantinÃ¦</i> are told from the
<i>IxodinÃ¦</i> by the absence of dorsal or ventral shields in both sexes,
and also by the rostrum being placed beneath the cephalothorax,
which covers it over: except in the larval stage, in which it is subterminal,
and in the pupal, when it partly projects. Legs nearly
equal in length. The sexual orifice is situated between the two first
pairs of legs. The males usually smaller than the females.</p>

<p>[The <i>IxodinÃ¦</i> have the legs unequal, of six segments with two
false segments, making them look as if composed of eight segments.
The rostrum is terminal and never hidden beneath the body.
The sexual orifice is situated between the bases of the first three
pairs of legs. In the males the orifice is obsolete or very rudimentary,
sexual intercourse being effected by the rostrum. The
males are smaller than the females. The shield in the females never
covers so much as one-half of the body even when fasting, also
in the larvÃ¦ and nymphs; but in the males, which do not distend,
the shield covers the body entirely, or all but a narrow margin.
The <i>IxodinÃ¦</i> are divided into two groups: (i) the <i>IxodÃ¦</i>, and (ii) the
<i>RhipicephalÃ¦</i>. The former have a long proboscis reaching nearly to
the end of the palpi or even a little longer than the palpi. The
palpi are longer than broad. The <i>RhipicephalÃ¦</i> have short palpi,
nearly or quite as broad as long, more or less conical or subtriangular.
They were called <i>Conipalpi</i> by Canestrini.</p>

<p>The dog tick (fig.&nbsp;360) lives in thickets on leaves, etc., and attacks sheep and
oxen, and more rarely dogs, horses, and human beings, into the skin of which the
female bores with the rostrum in order to suck blood; the bite is not dangerous, and
sometimes is not even felt. Inflammation, however, is set up if the creatures are
forcibly removed from the wound, as the rostrum as a rule is torn off in the process.
If left alone or smeared over with some grease&mdash;vaseline, oil, butter, etc.&mdash;the
creatures drop off spontaneously. Sometimes the entire tick bores itself into the
skin; they also appear to be permanent inmates of kennels.</p></div>

<p>[The species <i>I. reduvius</i> is the same as <i>I. ricinus</i>, Latreille.
The male is 2Â·35 to 2Â·80&nbsp;mm. long; the body is dark brown, almost
black, with a pale, almost white, margin; there are also traces
of reddish mottling. CoxÃ¦ of the first pair of legs with a short
spine. Rostrum much shorter than that of the female; shield oval;
anal shield small, about one-third the length of ventral shield. The
adult female varies from 2Â·80
to 3Â·5&nbsp;mm. when not distended,
but when gorged may reach
10&nbsp;mm. long. The shield and
legs are dark blackish-brown, body deep orange-red with four dark
longitudinal lines, paler beneath and light grey in front. When distending
it is pale red to grey or white; when fully gorged olive-green,
or dark red to black, with irregular yellow streaks on the back and sides
just before egg-laying. Sexual orifice opposite fourth pair of legs.
The nymph varies from 1Â·60 to 1Â·70&nbsp;mm. long when fasting; the
body is olive-white, opaque, with four distinct brown posterior
markings and similar anterior ones, leaving a pale centre to the
shield. When fully gorged it is 3&nbsp;mm. long. As the nymph distends,
it changes from opaque white to blue-black, and finally black. The
little larva is 0Â·80 to 1Â·50&nbsp;mm. long, transparent with olive-green
intestinal markings; as it becomes inflated it changes to blue-black,
and then black. There are no eyes. It is widely distributed, and
chiefly attacks sheep; sometimes it occurs on dogs and also attacks<span class="pagenum" title="499"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499"></a></span>
man. MÃ©gnin records it from horses in the nymph stage. Amongst
its other numerous hosts are goats, cattle, deer, hedgehogs, moles, bats,
birds, and lizards. It is usually known as the grass tick and bottle-nosed
tick. This species occurs in Europe, Asia, North Africa, and
North America.</p>

<p>[<i>Synonyms.</i>&mdash;Considerable confusion exists over the name of this
and other common ticks, owing to the same species having been
described under a great many names. Observers have taken the
same species on different animals and in various stages to be distinct,
and have described them accordingly.</p>

<p>[The name <i>Ixodes reduvius</i>, Leach, does not stand, as Leach was
describing quite a different parasite. The name <i>I. ricinus</i>, Latreille,
1806, is now substituted by Neumann and Wheler.</p>

<p>[The synonyms given by Wheler are as follow: <i>Reduvius</i>,
Charleton, 1668; <i>Ricinus caninus</i>, Ray, 1710; <i>Acarus ricinoides</i>,

<p class="spec"><b>Ixodes holocyclus</b>, Neumann, 1899.</p>

<p>[Under the name <i>I. holocyclus</i>, Cleland (<i>Journ. Trop. Med. and Hyg.</i>,
1913, xvi, No. 3, pp.&nbsp;43â45) says that: âThis tick is common in man
where there is dense scrub and tropical jungle along the east coast of
Australia at certain times of the year. It may cause severe symptoms
in children resulting in death.â He records a child being attacked in
1884 which died, and another case from which 200 ticks were
removed, the symptoms being weak heart, collapse, syncope, but the
patient recovered under treatment; again, in the same journal
(pp.&nbsp;188, 189), the case of a <span class="nowrap">4â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>-year-old girl who was bitten showed
widespread muscular paralysis, and other cases resembling conium
poison.</p>

<p>[Taylor (<i>Rep. Ent. Aust. Inst. Trop. Med.</i>, 1911, p.&nbsp;21, 1913)
refers to this species as the scrub tick of New South Wales.
The partially fed female has a dark reddish-yellow scutum and is
almost as broad as long, punctations very numerous, equal and
confluent in places, long white hairs on the lower half of each coxa.
He records it as attacking man commonly, mentioning Kamerunga,
Cairns district, Queensland, and Sydney, N.S.W., as localities.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

<p class="syn">Syn.: <i>Ixodes sexpunctatus</i>, Koch, 1897; <i>I. vulpis</i>, Pagenstecher, 1861.</p>

<p>Lives in the same manner as the foregoing; especially attacks
hounds, but also other mammals and even birds. The difference
consists in the shape of the legs, the shorter rostrum, and the larger
size of the male. It also occasionally attacks man, but is usually
confused with the previously mentioned species.</p>

1880. Two other synonyms are given above by Braun.</p>

<p>[The female when fully replete is 11&nbsp;mm. long, when fasting
3Â·86&nbsp;mm.; the shield is heart-shaped and punctate, body finely hairy;
palpi short and broad; labium shorter, and tarsi of all the legs more
truncate than in <i>I. ricinus</i>. The colour of the distended body is
drab and somewhat waxy; rostrum, shield and legs light testaceous.
The male varies from 3Â·5 to 4Â·0&nbsp;mm. long, and is reddish-brown
in colour with lighter legs; the shield is punctate and leaves a
narrow margin around the body; the body is elliptical, almost as
large in front as behind. There is a spine on the coxÃ¦ of the first
pair of legs, which is shorter than in the male <i>I. ricinus</i> and longer
than in the female. The genital orifice is opposite the interval
between the second and third pair of legs. The fasting <i>nymph</i> is
1Â·76&nbsp;mm. long, light bluish-grey, margined and transparent, with
four large posterior intestinal marks joined together behind the
shield and smaller ones extending to the front and sides. When
fully distended it is uniformly brownish-white; shield, legs and
rostrum pale testaceous. The <i>larva</i> varies from 0Â·88&nbsp;mm. when
fasting to 1Â·76&nbsp;mm. when gorged. Its body is light, but gradually
becomes darker, with similar intestinal marks to <i>ricinus</i>.</p>

<p>[This tick is very common, especially on ferrets, stoats and hedgehogs.
It is also found on sheep, cattle, etc. The males do not
generally occur in company with the females on the host. Pairing
probably takes place on the ground.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

Guiana, in Southern Texas, Florida, California, Mexico, Guatemala,
Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Bermuda, Cuba, Jamaica,
Trinidad, Colombia, Venezuela, French Guiana, Brazil, Paraguay
and the Argentine. It is called the silver tick. It frequently attacks
man. Schwarz and Bishopp (<i>Bull.</i> 105, U.S. Dept. Agric., p.&nbsp;158)
heard of one man whose legs were well covered with suppurating
sores and who was ill from the attack of these ticks and the wounds
produced by scratching, and records other cases of their swarming
on man. Newstead (<i>Ann. Trop. Med. and Par.</i>, 1909, iii, No. 4, p.&nbsp;442)

opening opposite the coxÃ¦ of the second pair of legs in both sexes.
Palpi a little longer than the labium; first segment short and narrow,
second and third widened on the dorsal face. CoxÃ¦ with a short,
broad blunt spine; tarsi short, terminated with a spur on the first

region, legs slightly lighter than scutum, joints tipped with
white. Female with scutum mostly covered with white, abdomen
reddish-brown, legs as in male. The nymph when unengorged
reddish-brown, when gorged dark bluish-grey; the larva is yellowish-brown
when unengorged, slate blue when engorged. The ova light
brown, shiny and smooth.</p>

<p>[The chief wild hosts are the brown bear, coyote, woodchuck,
rabbit, wild cat, badger and mountain goat for the larvÃ¦; practically
all small mammals act as hosts for larvÃ¦ and nymphÃ¦, whilst the
adults are seldom found on other than large domestic animals; horses
and cattle are preferred. It occurs in British Columbia, southward
to Northern New Mexico, and from the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains in Colorado to the base of the Cascade Range in Oregon
and California; abundant in Western Montana, Idaho, Eastern
Washington, Oregon, North Utah, West Wyoming and North-west
Colorado.</p>

<p>[Of great importance in the Bitter Root Valley of Montana, where
a number of cases of fever occur each year, with a mortality of about
70 per cent. In British Columbia this tick causes tick paralysis in
man and sheep. Only the adults seem to attack man and animals
there (Hadwen and Nuttall, <i>Parasitology</i>, 1913, vi, No. 3, pp.&nbsp;288â297
and 298â301) according to the <i>Canadian Medical Association
Journal</i>, December, 1912. The symptoms are unlike spotted
fever. For full details of this tick <i>vide Bulls.</i> 105 and 106, U.S.

<p class="spec"><b>Dermacentor occidentalis</b>, Neumann.</p>

<p>This tick only occurs in the Pacific Coast region of the United
States. Owing to the fact that it frequently attacks man as well as
occurring in great abundance in Oregon and California, it is of considerable
economic importance. It is spoken of as the wood tick, and
in the regions where found is the most common tick to attack man.
Hooker, Bishopp and Wood (<i>Bull.</i> 106, U.S. Dept. Agric., Div. Ent.,
1912, p.&nbsp;189) state that a number of cases have been brought to their
notice where the bite of this tick has caused considerable local inflammation,
which in some cases required physiciansâ attention. It has
been supposed to be connected with Rocky Mountain spotted fever,
but it is doubtful if it is concerned in its transmission. The engorged
female is steel grey, the dorsum with an olive-green surface colour,
which covers the grey except in small spots, giving a mottled
appearance. The unengorged males and females are reddish-brown,
scutum covered with a whitish bloom, interrupted by many red
punctures. The female is 9 by 6Â·1 by 3Â·3&nbsp;mm. to 11Â·8 by 7Â·6 by
5Â·6&nbsp;mm.; the male 2Â·8 by 1Â·6&nbsp;mm. to 4Â·2 by 2Â·3&nbsp;mm. The larvÃ¦
are bluish-grey when engorged, reddish-brown when unengorged.
The nymph is light brown, sides of scutum darker, and the
intestines dark brown. It is confined to the Coast Range and
Sierra Nevada Mountains in California and Oregon and the small
mountain range to the south-west.</p>

<p>The European marginated tick, <i>Argas reflexus</i> (length of male
4&nbsp;mm., breadth 3&nbsp;mm., length of female 6 to 8&nbsp;mm., breadth
4&nbsp;mm.), is of a yellowish colour and has yellowish-white legs. The
ingested blood shows red or brown through the intestine, which is
provided with blind sacs. It lives in dovecots. It remains hidden
during the day and at night crawls on to the sleeping pigeons to suck
their blood. It has been observed in France, England, Italy, Germany,
and Russia. Persons sleeping near infected dovecots, or in apartments
formed from pigeon-lofts, are also attacked, even when the
room in question has not been used for sheltering pigeons for years,
as âmarginated ticksâ can live in a fasting condition for a very long
time. The bite sometimes gives rise to serious symptoms, such as
general erythema and sudden Ådema.</p>

<p>[This pest more often feeds on the blood
of man than is imagined. Blanchard states
that he has received them from menâs clothes
in Strasburg. Boschulte, of Westphalia, records
these parasites in a bedroom inhabited
by children and connected with a pigeon-house.
The children were bitten during sleep
on the hands and feet. The result of the bite
was intense itching along the nerves, the bite
only being marked by a red spot. In a girl
of 14 or 15, vesicles were formed similar to
those produced by burns, and in an old man
an ulcer formed. Others record painful punctures
and persistent Ådema produced by this
pigeon pest. It was once abundant in Canterbury Cathedral, and
often caused much annoyance, I am told, to the worshippers; the
ticks falling down from the roof, where they were living, derived
from the numerous pigeons that breed in the towers. This Acarus
has enormous powers of vitality, living without food for months at
a time.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Argas persicus</b>, Fischer de Waldheim, 1824.</p>

<p>Of oval form and brownish-red colour. The male measures 4 to
5&nbsp;mm. in length by 3&nbsp;mm. in breadth; the female 7 to 10&nbsp;mm. in
length by 5 to 6&nbsp;mm. in breadth. It frequents the entire north-west<span class="pagenum" title="507"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507"></a></span>
and north-east of Persia (the gerib-gez or malleh of the Persians, the
miana bug of travellers). It lives concealed in houses and attacks
man at night to suck his blood. Its bite is much dreaded, but the
serious results may probably be attributed to unsuitable treatment of
the wound or its invasion by bacteria.</p>

<p>[This tick, sometimes called the tampan and wandlius in South
Africa, is mainly a fowl parasite. Fowls and ducks frequently die
under its attack, particularly young ones, death being due to loss
of blood. This tick remains attached to its host during its larval
stage for about five days; it then leaves and moults in concealment.
In its subsequent stages it visits its host by night and remains for
about an hour only, during which time it distends itself fully with
blood. As a nymph it moults twice, not once as do the cattle ticks.
This tick and other Argas become larger with each moult, but retain
their same general appearance. The female visits the host every now
and then, and, between, deposits eggs in sheltered crevices. About
fifty to 120 are deposited at once. Four weeks seems a necessary
period to intervene between visits to the host, and the interval may
be extended to upwards of a year according to Lounsbury.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<p>[It is found in the Sudan, where Balfour
has found granules derived from the segmentation
of spirilla in their digestive tract.
Fantham and Hindl have confirmed this. It
has been assumed that these granules carry
infection.</p>

<p>[This so-called Persian tick, the miana,
which is such a scourge to travellers in Persia,
appears to infest the huts of natives in that
country. It has been sent me from Quetta,
where it has invaded houses to such an extent
the natives cannot live in them. The virulence
of its bite is probably due to the tick transmitting
fever germs from natives, probably inured, to strangers, who
would be susceptible.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

<p class="spec"><b>Ornithodorus moubata</b>, Murray, 1877.</p>

<p>An abundant African tick which is one of the carriers of the
spirillum of African relapsing fever and can also carry <i>Filaria perstans</i>
(Christy). Its body is oval, yellowish-brown when young, greenish-brown
when mature. The integument is covered with mamillose
tubercles. No eyes and the stout legs granular above, the tibiÃ¦ and
tarsi fringed with tubercles on the upper side. Pocock<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> records it from<span class="pagenum" title="509"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509"></a></span>
Uganda and German East Africa, Congo and Angola, to Namaqualand
and the Transvaal in the south. It is called <i>bibo</i> in Uganda, <i>moubata</i>
in Angola, and <i>tampan</i> on the Lower Zambesi. It feeds on animals
and birds as well as man. Its bite is very painful. This tick is found
in native huts, living in cracks and crevices and in the thatch roofs.</p>

<p>The female tick infected with the spirillum transmits the infection
to the eggs and the next generation. They appear to be able to live
without food a long time, and probably live for years. They lay their
eggs in masses on the ground or in crevices, and when they hatch
they are in the nymph stage with four pairs of legs. <i>O. moubata</i> also
occurs in Madagascar with recurrent fever (Lamoureux, <i>Bull. Soc.
Path, exot.</i>, 1913, vi, No. 3, pp.&nbsp;146â149).</p>

out in Arizona (<i>Lancet</i>, 1901, i, No. 4,052, p.&nbsp;1198, fig.&nbsp;3).</p>

<p>[This species attacks the horse, ass, dog, cats and oxen, generally
around the ears, and also attacks man. It is well known in the
United States as infesting the ears of children (<i>New York Ent. Soc.
Journ.</i>, 1893, pp.&nbsp;49â52).</p>

<p>[It occurs in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California as well
as Mexico, Brazil, and possibly many parts of South America; and
recently Bedford (âSec. Report Div. Vet. Res., S. African Union,â
1912, pp.&nbsp;343, 344) has shown it to occur at Vryburg and Fauresmith,
in the Transvaal, on stock. It also occurs in the Sudan.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

<p class="spec">Family. <b>TyroglyphidÃ¦.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Very small mites without eyes and without tracheÃ¦, with smooth skin.</p>

<p>The males usually have a suctorial pore on either side of the anus, which is used
during copulation, or suckers may be found in both sexes near the sexual orifice.
The mouth parts form a cone with chelate chelicerÃ¦, and three-jointed pedipalpi;
the legs are usually short, have five segments with a terminal claw and suckers, or
either one or other of these organs. The numerous species and genera live free and
from choice in slowly decomposing vegetable and animal matter (cheese, cereals, flour,
sugar, preserves, dried anatomical preparations, bacon, dried fruits and fungi), also in
the corners of dwellings, etc.; they incidentally get into or on to man, or are found in
chamber utensils and in spittoons; actual parasites are rarely found amongst them.</p>

<p>[The chief genera are Tyroglyphus, Rhizoglyphus, Glyciphagus, Aleurobius
and Histiogaster. The first three have typical characters referred to, but are
distinguished from each other by the two former having the hairs on the dorsum
smooth, whilst in Glyciphagus they are hairy, plumose, or feathered. Rhizoglyphus
can be told from Tyroglyphus by having claws on the tarsi without any suckers;
Tyroglyphus has both claws and suckers. The larvÃ¦ are hexapod and may become
adult in the usual way by repeated moults, or they enter the so-called hypopial
stage. In this the eight-legged nymph becomes quiescent, and during this stage
it fixes itself to some insect or other animal by a patch of suckers on the lower
surface of the hind end of the body, and is so carried from place to place. The
hypopus does not feed and has a hard shell and short legs. When it has reached
a new home it moults and development proceeds in the normal way. Canestrini
and Kramer treat the <i>TyroglyphidÃ¦</i> as a sub-family of the <i>SarcoptidÃ¦</i>, calling them
sub-family <i>TyroglyphinÃ¦</i>, the other sub-families being <i>SarcoptinÃ¦</i>, <i>CanestriniinÃ¦</i> and
<i>AnalsinÃ¦</i>.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p></div>

<p>It is to these species that a case of dysentery was referred.
Rolander, who studied under LinnÃ¦us, was attacked by what was
called dysentery. The complaint soon gave way to treatment,
but eight days after it returned, soon disappeared, but again
came a third time. All the time Rolander had been living like
the other inmates of the house, who all escaped. LinnÃ¦us, aware
that Bartholemy had attributed dysentery to insects which he
said he had seen, advised his student to examine his stool. The
result was that innumerable mites were found to be present. Their
presence was easily accounted for by the fact that they were found
in numbers in a cup made of juniper wood from which the student
alone drank of a night, and they were found to be of the same species.
What this species is we do not know. LinnÃ¦us called it <i>Acarus
dysenteriÃ¦</i>, but it was the same as his <i>Acarus siro</i>. No records have<span class="pagenum" title="513"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513"></a></span>
occurred since. It cannot be, as Latreille supposed, the cheese mite,
for they have been eaten by millions since, and it is strange no such
case has occurred again.</p>

It was taken from beneath the cuticle of the sole of the foot of
a negro in the Seamenâs Hospital Ship on the Thames in 1841,
in large sores of a peculiar character confined to the soles of the<span class="pagenum" title="514"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514"></a></span>
feet. It appeared that the disease was caused by its burrowing
beneath the thick cuticle. The disease was attributed to the
wearing of a pair of shoes which had been lent to another negro
whose feet had been similarly affected for nearly a year. The negro
to whom the shoes were lent came from Sierra Leone. Mr. Busk
stated that some water brought by Dr. Stranger from the River
Sinoe, on the coast of Africa, contained one nearly perfect specimen,
and fragments of others very similar to if not identical with this
Acarus. Mr. Busk adds that he had been informed by Staff-Assistant
Surgeon P.&nbsp;D. Murray that at Sierra Leone there is a
native pustular disease called craw-craw&mdash;a species of itch breaking
into open sores.</p>

<p class="spec">Family. <b>SarcoptidÃ¦</b> (Itch Mites).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Small mites without eyes and tracheÃ¦, and with delicate, transversely striated
cuticle. The mouth parts form a cone, over which the shield-shaped upper lip
protrudes; the chelicerÃ¦ are chelate; the pedipalpi (or maxillary palpi) have three
joints; the legs are short and compact, and composed of five segments; the terminal
joints have pedunculated suckers (ambulacra) or a long bristle. The larvÃ¦ are six-legged.
They live on or under the skin of birds and mammals, on which they
produce the skin disease known as scabies, or itch.</p>

<p>[The <i>SarcoptidÃ¦</i> attack the hairs, feathers or epidermis of birds, animals and
man, living as permanent parasites. The punctures they produce are followed by
the formation of more or less thick crusts or scabs, beneath which the mites live and
breed (so called scab, mange and itch). Most are oviparous, some ovoviviparous.
The eggs are minute, ovoid, with a thin semi-transparent shell. They incubate in
a few days, varying from two to ten or eleven, as a rule. Generally sarcoptic<span class="pagenum" title="517"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517"></a></span>
diseases lie dormant in winter and revive in spring and summer in man; but in
animals with long wool, such as sheep, they are most active during winter, although
revival of active reproduction takes place in spring.</p>

<p>[Speaking generally, for the <i>SarcoptidÃ¦</i> there are three distinct stages in the
development of the male, four in the female, as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>[(1) The larva. In this stage only three pairs of legs occur.</p>

<p>[(2) The nymph, in which a fourth pair of legs appear, and which thus approaches
the adult; but so far no sexual organs occur. Nymphs are of two sizes&mdash;the
smaller being future males, the larger females.</p>

<p>[(3) The next stage in the female is the age of <i>puberty</i>, the female now being
provided with a vulvo-anal slit; this so-called <i>pubescent female</i> is fertilized by the male.
The male then dies. But the female again casts her skin and enters another <span class="nowrap">stage&mdash;</span></p>

<p>[(4) The ovigerous female&mdash;the egg-laying female&mdash;which has differently modified
legs.</p>

<p>[The rate at which these Acari breed is very great. Gerlach has found that
roughly, in each Sarcopt gallery, a female produces fifteen individuals&mdash;ten females
and five males&mdash;and that the progeny reproduce again in fifteen days. The table
given below thus shows that one pair may produce the enormous number of
1,500,000 descendants in three <span class="nowrap">months:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>[The <i>SarcoptinÃ¦</i> alone interest us here, and of the nine genera the three following

<p>[(1) Sarcoptes, Latreille; Eusarcoptes.</p>

<p>[(2) Psoroptes, Gerv.; Dermatodectes, Gerlach; Dermatocoptes, FÃ¼rstenberg.</p>

<p>[(3) Chorioptes, Gerv.; Symbiotes, Gerlach; Dermatophagus, FÃ¼rst.; Sarco-dermatocedes,
Del.</p>

<p>[The following are the main characters of these three <span class="nowrap">genera:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sarcoptes</i>&mdash;round or slightly oval; the two posterior pairs of legs being nearly or
quite concealed beneath the body; the tarsi end in simple long pedicles, with
ambulatory suckers.</p>

<p>[<i>Psoroptes</i>&mdash;oval; the legs are all visible outside the margin of the body; the
ambulatory suckers are carried on long triangulated stalks; the male has copulatory
suckers and abdominal prolongations.</p>

<p>[<i>Chorioptes</i>&mdash;oval; legs long, thick, all visible; ambulatory suckers very wide,
carried at the end of simple, short pedicles.</p>

<p>[Sarcoptes make channels or furrows beneath the epidermis, and in these the
female lays her eggs. This form of acariasis is thus difficult to cure. It is the cause
of human itch (<i>vide Sarcoptes scabiei</i>).</p>

<p>[Psoroptes do not make sub-epidermic galleries; they live and breed in colonies
beneath crusts or scabs formed by the changes they produce in their hostâs skin.
Sheep scab is a common type of disease produced by Psoroptes. This genus is of
little importance as a parasite to man.</p>

<p>[Chorioptes live as Psoroptes; they also do not affect man. Otodectes, Can.,

<p>The body is oval or nearly circular and whitish in colour, with transverse
rows of striÃ¦ partly interrupted on the back. There are transverse
rows of small bristles
on the dorsal surface, and
groups of trichomÃ¦ on
the front, sides and back.
There are chitinous hairs at
the base of the legs; the two first
pairs are provided with
pedunculated ambulacra in
both sexes, the two posterior
pairs terminate each with a
long bristle in the female;
in the male the third pair
of legs terminate in a bristle,
the fourth pair with a pedunculated
ambulacrum. The
anus is situated at the posterior
border of the dorsal
surface.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At one time numerous species
were differentiated, according to
the form of the Acarus, the number,
position and size of the hairs
and spines, even according to the
hosts, etc. All these characteristics,
however, fluctuate so considerably
that absolute differentiation is impossible; the supposed species may be
regarded in the same light as MÃ©gnin did, as varieties. It is also hardly possible
to distinguish the mite of human scabies (<i>S. hominis</i>) from that of a number of
domestic animals (<i>S. squamiferus)</i>. It is best, therefore, to accept one single species
(<i>S. scabiei</i>), which may give rise to different races or castes by living in the skin
of man and mammals, but can pass from one host to the other.</p></div>

<p>[Canestrini and Kramer, in their monograph of the <i>SarcoptidÃ¦</i>,
enumerate eighteen distinct species of this genus, from the dog, goat,<span class="pagenum" title="519"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519"></a></span>
camel, horse, ferret, lion, wolf, sheep, pig, etc., and two species

that they are distinct species.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

<p>The <i>S. scabiei</i> of man (<i>S. scabiei</i> var. <i>hominis</i>) (length of male
0Â·2 to 0Â·3&nbsp;mm., and breadth 0Â·145 to 0Â·190&nbsp;mm.; length of female
0Â·33 to 0Â·45&nbsp;mm., and breadth 0Â·25 to 0Â·35&nbsp;mm.) lives in the tunnels
that it excavates in the epidermis, and attacks by preference places
with thin skin, such as between the fingers, in the bend of the
elbows and knees, in the inguinal region, on the penis, on the
mammÃ¦, but may also affect other parts. The tunnels, which
vary from a few millimetres to a centimetre and more long, do not
run straight, but are somewhat
tortuous; the female is found
at the terminal end. The tunnels
contain the excrement and
oval eggs (0Â·14&nbsp;mm. in length)
of the parasite; the males are
rarely met with, as they die off
after copulation; the females
die after depositing their eggs.
The six-legged larvÃ¦ hatch
out after four to eight days,
and after about a fortnight,
during which time they change
their skins three times and
undergo metamorphosis, they
begin themselves to burrow.
Transmission from person to
person rarely is effected
through linen, but by direct
contact (as in coitus); transmission
can be artificially
effected on horses, dogs and
monkeys, but not on cats.</p>

<p>The smaller <i>S. scabiei-crustosÃ¦</i>,
FÃ¼rstenberg, is the cause of the itch that occurs chiefly in
Norway; it is not certain whether this is a distinct species of
itch mite.</p>

<p>[This is quite a distinct species, which is recorded from Germany and
France. MÃ©gnin (<i>Parasitology</i>, 1880, p.&nbsp;165) described this as <i>S. scabiei</i>
var. <i>lupi</i>. The female is 140&nbsp;Âµ long, 340&nbsp;Âµ broad; the male is 170&nbsp;Âµ long
by 150&nbsp;Âµ broad. In <i>Science</i> (March 3, 1893, p.&nbsp;125) is recorded that
at the Indiana Academy of Science Dr. Robert Hessler referred to
âa case of that extremely rare and almost extinct form of itch<span class="pagenum" title="520"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520"></a></span>
known as âNorway itch,â the <i>scabies norvegica</i> of Hebra, 1852.â
The afflicted man was covered with thick, creamy white, leathery
scales; some of these scales measured over an inch in diameter and
<span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">10</span></span></span>&nbsp;in. thick. A constant shedding of scales went on, a handful
being gathered daily. They were found full of mites and eggs and
riddled with passages. Under treatment the mites were killed and
the skin became normal. Dr. Hessler made a calculation of the
number of eggs and mites, amounting to ova and shells 7,004,000,
mites in all stages 2,009,000.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

itch mite of the rabbit to the cat does not succeed. In man <i>S. minor</i>
induces an eruption that disappears after about a fortnight.</p>

<p>[<i>S. minor</i>, FÃ¼rstenberg, 1861 (âKrÃ¤tzm.,â viii, p.&nbsp;218), comes in

<p>The itch mites of domestic animals, which belong to the genera Psoroptes
(= Dermatodectes = Dermatocoptes) and Chorioptes (Symbiotes = Dermatophagus),
as a rule do not infest and live on man, even when artificially transmitted. It is,
however, possible for this to occur. Moniez (âTraitÃ© de par.,â 1896, p.&nbsp;559)
mentions that a species of Chorioptes&mdash;probably <i>Ch. bovis</i>&mdash;had been found on man,
as had also <i>Demodex folliculorum</i>. This author also includes <i>Dermatophagoides
scheremetewskyi</i>, Bogdanoff (<i>Bull. soc. imp. d. natural.</i>, <i>Moscou</i>, 1864, xxxvii,

<p>As in <i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i>, numerous varieties of this species are
known; the form parasitic on man lives in the hair-follicles, the
meibomian and sebaceous glands, and hardly ever causes inconvenience;
the male measures 0Â·3&nbsp;mm. in length and
the female about 0Â·4&nbsp;mm. in length. The eggs
0Â·06 to 0Â·08&nbsp;mm. in length, 0Â·04 to 0Â·05&nbsp;mm. in
breadth, and are thin-shelled. The creatures are
always attached with the head end downwards in
the parts mentioned; they are most frequent in
the sebaceous glands of the face, by the nose, lips
and forehead, but they may be present on the
abdomen and on other parts of the body. They
may occasionally obstruct the excretory gland ducts,
thus causing inflammation of the gland (comedones);
their agglomeration in the meibomian glands sets
up inflammation of the margins of the eyelids.
There are generally only a few specimens in a gland.
According to some statements Demodex occurs in
50 per cent. of mankind and even in children; they
survive the death of their hosts by several days.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The variety living in the dog (<i>D. folliculorum</i> var. <i>canis</i>)
is smaller than the variety living in man, and produces a skin
disease resembling scabies in these animals. According to
ZÃ¼rn they may also live on man; nevertheless, no other investigator has recorded
a similar observation, and attempts at artificial infection have proved negative.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></p></div>

<p>[Ten distinct species of Demodex are given by Canestrini and
Kramer (âDemodicidae und Sarcoptidae,â <i>Das Tierreich</i>, 1899, vii).
The species are certainly distinct.</p>

<p>[The species living on the dog (<i>D. canis</i>, Leydig, 1844) is cosmopolitan.
According to the <i>British Medical Journal</i> (February 22, 1913,<span class="pagenum" title="523"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523"></a></span>

Hobday describe in the <i>Veterinary Journal</i> seventeen cases which

<p class="tac">Family. <b>LinguatulidÃ¦.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Arachnida</i> greatly altered in consequence of their parasitic manner of life;
for a long time they were regarded as helminthes. The body is elongated,
vermiform, flattened or cylindrical, and more or less distinctly annulated. The
head, thorax, and abdomen are not defined from each other (fig.&nbsp;371). The elliptical
mouth, surrounded by a chitinous ring, is situated at the anterior end, on the
ventral surface, and the intestine leading straight through the body opens at the
posterior end. Two retractile hooks are at the sides of the mouth (fig.&nbsp;372); these
are usually considered to be the terminal joints of two pairs of legs, but it appears
to be more correct to regard them as the remains of the antennÃ¦ and palpi (Stiles).
According to this opinion, the legs in the adult state are completely degenerated.</p>

<p>The nervous system is reduced to an Åsophageal ring. No organs of sense are
recognizable except the papillÃ¦ at the anterior end. There are neither organs of
circulation nor of respiration.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></p>

<p>The sexes are distinct. In the small male the sexual orifice is situated ventrally
in the anterior part of the body; in the female it is placed near the anus. The
<i>LinguatulidÃ¦</i> lay eggs, and from each egg, after being conveyed into an intermediate
host, a four-legged larva, with rudimentary mouth parts, hatches out. It
goes through a series of metamorphoses, and passes through a second larval
condition, which, however, possesses the essential characteristics of the fully
developed form. Sooner or later it migrates during this stage, and reaches its final
host, mammal or reptile, in the nostrils or lungs of which the adult <i>LinguatulidÃ¦</i>
live.</p></div>

<p>[As adults they live as internal blood feeders in various birds,
reptiles and mammals, especially in the nasal and respiratory
passages. The larval stage occurs in another host in an encysted
condition; this host is usually an animal preyed upon by the species
in which the sexual forms are found. The larvÃ¦ bore through the
walls of the hostâs stomach and enter liver and spleen or brain, where
they encyst; here they grow until they assume almost the appearance
of the adult. These encysted larvÃ¦ on being eaten later make their
way into the nasal passages and lungs, where they mature. Both
adults and larvÃ¦ occur in man, as mentioned later.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;The ova,
which are found in masses in
the nasal mucus, already possess
an embryo; they are expelled
with the nasal secretion, and
are swallowed by herbivorous
mammals with their food,
mostly by hares and rabbits,
but also by sheep, goats, oxen,
horses, antelopes, fallow deer,
pigs, cats, and occasionally also
by human beings. The young
larvÃ¦ hatch out in the stomach;
they possess a thickened anterior
body with rudimentary
mouth parts and two pairs of
limbs; the body gradually tapers to a short tail.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ of the <i>LinguatulidÃ¦</i> bore through the intestinal wall
and reach the liver, more rarely the mesenteric glands, etc.; they
here become encysted and enter a sort of pupal stage in which they
lose their limbs; after several moultings and gradual growth the
second larval stage, having the appearance of the adult Linguatula,<span class="pagenum" title="525"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525"></a></span>
sets in. About five to six months after infection the creatures have
become 4 to 6&nbsp;mm. long, possess eighty to ninety rings, which have
a series of fine points on their posterior border; the mouth and
intestine are formed, the sexual organs mature and the two pairs of
hooks are near the mouth. This larval stage (fig.&nbsp;372) has been
known for a long time, but it was regarded as an independent species
of animal, and therefore had a separate name (<i>Linguatula serrata</i>,
Fr.; <i>Pentastoma denticalatum</i>, Rud., etc.).</p>

<p>Later these Linguatula larvÃ¦ make an attempt to escape from their
hosts, and this, of course, can only be effected by means of an active
migration; they leave the cysts, and according to their respective
positions in the abdominal or pleural cavities they reach the bronchi
or the intestine, and finally pass out; they may be again sniffed up
by dogs and settle in their nasal cavities. Still this outward migration
does not appear to be necessary for further development. A
portion of the larvÃ¦ gain access to the nasal cavities directly through
the trachea, and thus herbivorous mammals certainly become directly
infected. In most cases the infection of dogs, wolves and foxes, that
is, of carnivorous mammals, takes place through consuming the
bodies of mammals, or parts of them, such as the liver and
lungs, which are affected with the second larval form; in any case
most larvÃ¦ obtain access first to the stomach of their host, from
here they make an active migration through the Åsophagus to the
oral and nasal cavities, in which they settle. It is possible also that<span class="pagenum" title="526"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526"></a></span>
the same larvÃ¦ which are free in the oral cavity when the food is
being eaten migrate into the nasal cavities. After being stationary
a fresh skin is formed and the spine-bearing cuticula are thrown off.
The male attains its full size in the fourth, and the female in the sixth
month. The duration of life is stated to be from fifteen months to
several years.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>L. rhinaria</i> has been observed in man in the adult as well as in the larval
condition (<i>Pentastoma denticulatum</i>). Zenker first called attention to the occurrence
of the larva in man, having found it nine times in the liver in 168 autopsies. Heschl
found it twice in Vienna in twenty autopsies, Virchow found it in WÃ¼rzburg and Berlin,
Wagner in Leipzig (10 per cent.), and Frerichs in Breslau five times in forty-seven
autopsies. The parasite is much less frequent in Switzerland. According to Klebs,
one case occurs in 900 autopsies, and according to Zaeslin two cases occurred in Basle
to 1,914 autopsies. In the Seamenâs Hospital in Kronstadt <i>P. denticulatum</i> has been
found six times in 659 autopsies. It was almost always the liver that contained one
or a few specimens. The parasite was very rarely found in the kidney or spleen, or
encysted in the intestinal wall. The adult <i>L. rhinaria</i> is far more rarely observed
in man.</p>

<p>A case reported by Landon that related to a blacksmith of Elbing is particularly
interesting. This man accompanied the campaign of 1870; he soon, however, fell
ill with pains in the liver, accompanied by icterus and intestinal disorders. Soon
after the war, and after the symptoms were reduced to icterus and weakness, bleeding
of the nose set in and continued with slight intermissions for seven years; an
unpleasant sensation of pressure in the left nasal cavity set in, with inflammatory
swelling of the mucous membrane. At last, in the summer of 1878, when the
pressure in the nose had considerably increased, a Linguatula was expelled from the
nose with a violent attack of sneezing, and lived for three days longer in water. The
bleeding of the nose then ceased and the patient soon recovered. There can be no
doubt that the first illness was connected with the invasion in the liver of numerous
larvÃ¦ of Pentastoma, and disappeared after their encystment; one or a few of these
must subsequently have found its way to the nose and settled there.</p></div>

<p class="tac"><b>Porocephalus constrictus</b>, v. Siebold, 1852.</p>

<p class="synj">Syn.: <i>Nematoideum hominis</i>, Diesing, 1851; <i>Pentastomum constrictum</i>,
v. Sieb., 1852; <i>Porocephalus constrictus</i>, Stiles, 1893.</p>

<p>Porocephalus is distinguished from Linguatula by its cylindrical
body and by certain internal structures. <i>Porocephalus constrictus</i>
is at present only known in its larval stage. It is milk white in
colour with golden-yellow hooklets. Number of rings, twenty-three.
Length 13&nbsp;mm., breadth 2Â·2&nbsp;mm. There are no prickles on the
posterior border of the annulations of the body.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This species was first discovered by Pruner encysted in the livers of two
negroes in Cairo. Bilharz reported two further cases in which the parasites
were encysted in the liver and in the mucosa of the intestine; a few other observations
have been made by Fenger, Aitken, Giard and Chalmas. Aitkenâs report deals
with soldiers of the British Colonies in Africa. The parasites were discovered in<span class="pagenum" title="527"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527"></a></span>
the liver as well as in the lung, and appear to have been the cause of death in one
case (pneumonia, peritonitis).</p></div>

<p>Pruner has found the same parasite also in the liver of the giraffe.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It has recently been assumed that <i>Porocephalus constrictus</i> is the larva of
<i>Pentastoma moniliforme</i>, Diesing, 1835, that attains a length of 70&nbsp;mm. and lives
in the lungs of African Pythonides. The larva is known to have been ejected
from monkeys (<i>Cercopithecus albogularis</i>, <i>Cynocephalus maimon</i>), from the giraffe
(<i>Camelopardalis giraffa</i>), from a species of hyÃ¦na (<i>Proteles cristatus</i>), and should
be expected to occur frequently in smaller mammals which have been swallowed
by African serpents of enormous size.</p></div>

<p>[The three species of <i>PentastomidÃ¦</i>, or tongue worms, found in
man are <i>Linguatula serrata</i>, FrÃ¶lich; <i>Porocephalus armillatus</i>, Wyman;
and <i>Pentastoma moniliformis</i>, Diesing.</p>

<p>[(1) <i>Linguatula serrata</i> has been referred to under a great number
of names.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> It is a frequent parasite in dogs, oxen and sheep; as an
adult in the dog and also in the fox and wolf. The nymphal stage is
found in rats, hares, rabbits, the horse, oxen, sheep, goats, pigs, camels,
deer, the African and long-eared hedgehogs, porcupine, guinea-pig
and peccary. In man it is found in both adult and nymphal stages.
Sambon says the nymphal stage is of frequent occurrence, but is
usually overlooked. Zenker, who first found it in man, obtained it in
nine out of 160 <i>post-mortems</i>, usually encysted in the liver. It is then
said to be harmless. Landon, in 1878, found the adult in man, the
patient suffering from epistaxis for about seven years; in the end
during a fit of sneezing the living parasite was ejected through the
nostril. This case is of particular interest as it appears to suggest
that this Acarid may now and then pass its entire development in the
same host, or at any rate may actively migrate from the liver to the
nasal cavities after a period of encystment in the liver or elsewhere,
which has also been observed in herbivorous animals (<i>vide</i> also p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_526">526</a>).</p>

<p>[It is recorded from man in Central America (Darling, <i>Bull.
Soc. Path. exot.</i>, 1912, v, p.&nbsp;118; and again <i>Arch. Int. Med.</i>, 1912, v,
p. 401), also from Rio de Janeiro (<i>Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz</i>, 1913,
fasc. ii, p.&nbsp;125) by Faria and Travassos.</p>

<p>[(2) <i>Porocephalus armillatus</i>, Wyman, is also known under a variety
<span class="pagenum" title="528"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528"></a></span>of names.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> This species is widely spread over tropical Africa. The
adult stage is found in pythons and puff-adders, the nymphal in the
chimpanzee, Sykes monkey, mandrill and other monkeys, the lion,
leopard, banded ichneumon, Aard wolf, dog, black rat, South African
reedbuck and the giraffe. The adult has never been found in man
or any mammal. No fewer than sixteen cases of the nymphal form,
Sambon tells us, have been found in man, and it is probably much
more widespread than at present known. So far it has only been
found in the African natives. This species has sixteen to seventeen
body rings in the male, eighteen to twenty-two in the female, and the
body does not taper as much as in the next species.</p>

<p>[(3) <i>Pentastoma moniliformis</i>, Diesing,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> is an Oriental species, found
in India, Indo-China and South China, and the Malay Archipelago.
The adult occurs in both the Indian and reticulated pythons.
The nymphal stage has been found in monkeys, the tiger, the civet and
the Indian otter.</p>

<p>[The nymph has twice been found in man; in one case in the liver
of a Filipino, the other in the serous coat of the small intestine of a
native of Sumatra.</p>

<p>[This species can be told by the female having twenty-nine to
thirty-three body rings, the male twenty-six, and the annulations are
more bead-like and less prominent than in the African species.</p>

<p>[In addition to these three, Sambon thinks it probable that others
occur in man.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

<h4><i>B.</i> <b>INSECTA</b> (<i>Hexapoda</i>).</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Three separate regions can always be distinguished in the body of insects,
namely, the head, thorax and abdomen. The <span class="lowercase smcap">HEAD</span> is a roundish unsegmented
capsule and possesses four pairs of appendages. The first pair are the various
shaped feelers (antennÃ¦), which are placed on the superior surface of the head next
to the eyes; then more ventrally placed a pair of upper jaws (mandibles) without
palpi and without articulations; they are powerful masticatory organs.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> The first
pair of lower jaws (maxillÃ¦) are jointed and bear a palpus (palpus maxillaris); the
second pair of maxillÃ¦ are soldered together and form the lower lip (labium), and
likewise carry a palpus labialis on each side. The upper lip (labrum), as well as
the other parts (which, however, are only appendages), belong to the mouth, which
is really formed of a number of closely united pieces. The mouth parts are modified
according to the functions required of them. <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Neuroptera</i>, and <i>Orthoptera</i>
have biting or masticatory mouth parts which conform with the scheme
described above. In the licking mouth parts of the <i>Hymenoptera</i> the maxillÃ¦ and
under lip are considerably elongated, while the mandibles retain their form
and are used for triturating the food; in the <i>Lepidoptera</i> nearly all the mouth
parts are shortened except the maxillÃ¦, which form a long and sometimes spirally
rolled suctorial proboscis; the <i>Diptera</i> and <i>Rhynchota</i> have piercing and sucking
mouth parts. The mandibles and maxillÃ¦ are metamorphosed into needle-like
structures, while the suctorial apparatus is formed by the labrum.</p>

<p>The thorax consists of three segments, which are frequently united; ventrally it
carries three pairs of legs, which consist of a definite number of articulated pieces
joined together. Their form also changes according to their function, so that legs
for running, walking, digging, swimming, jumping, and preying are seen. A pair
of wings are respectively attached to the last and last but one thoracic rings, and
these may be traced back, not to metamorphosed appendages, but to tracheal
branchia. They are composed of chitinous membranes supported by branched
structures (veins or ribs). Their size and formation vary; they are seldom of equal
size and form (<i>Neuroptera</i>); often the posterior wings are larger than the anterior
wings, the former then only serving as protective coverings for the latter
(<i>Coleoptera</i>), or the anterior wings are larger (<i>Lepidoptera</i>), or the posterior wings
are shortened or are entirely absent (<i>Diptera</i>); and finally there are insects in
which both pairs of wings are lacking.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a></p>

<p>The abdomen retains its segmentation, but, with the exception of a few groups
related to the primitive forms of insects, has no appendages in the imago condition;
the abdomen usually consists of ten segments, on the last of which the anus
is situated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="530"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530"></a></span></p>

<p>We need only observe the following characters in considering the anatomy of
<span class="nowrap">insects:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">EPIDERMIS</span> consists of the chitinous cuticle, which is separate from the
cellular layer beneath (hypodermis); the various appendages are supported by the
chitinous layer.</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">INTESTINAL CANAL</span> usually consists of the anterior, median and terminal
intestine, and as a rule passes straight through the body; salivary glands discharge
into the anterior part, and, in some cases, yield a stiffening secretion which serves
for spinning webs; numerous or scanty hepatic tubes are appended to the median
intestine, while on the border between the median and terminal intestine open four
to six long tubes (vasa malpighiana), which act as urinary organs. Finally the end
portion of the intestine carries various glands (anal and rectal glands, etc.).</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM</span> agrees in structure with that of the Annelids,
but is more highly developed. The pharyngeal ring surrounds the front part of the
intestine; the sensory nerves originate from its <span class="lowercase smcap">SUPERIOR PHARYNGEAL GANGLIA</span>
and are the seat of the higher psychical functions; the <span class="lowercase smcap">INFERIOR PHARYNGEAL
GANGLIA</span> govern the mouth parts, and in addition appear to regulate the movements
(cerebellum) of the vertebrates.</p>

<p>The chain of <span class="lowercase smcap">GANGLIA</span> lying on the ventral side of the abdomen consists primitively
of pairs of ganglia corresponding with the twelve segments, which are connected
by longitudinal and transverse commissures. But many changes in the ganglia may
be seen in insects caused by partial or entire amalgamation of single ganglia, so that
in a few cases only one abdominal ganglion is present. In conclusion, a definite
<span class="lowercase smcap">INTESTINAL NERVOUS SYSTEM</span> is always present.</p>

<p>Of the organs of sense the <span class="lowercase smcap">FACETTED EYES</span>, situated at the sides of the head,
deserve special mention, as do also the <span class="lowercase smcap">ORGANS OF TOUCH</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">SMELL</span>, situated on
the antennÃ¦, and the <span class="lowercase smcap">ORGANS OF HEARING</span> and taste, or finer sensations, situated at
the mouth and in the buccal cavity.</p>

<p>The sounds emitted by insects are, as a rule, produced by the friction or beating
of certain chitinous parts, but sounds are also produced in breathing (flies).</p>

<p>The <span class="lowercase smcap">ORGANS OF RESPIRATION</span>, the so-called tracheÃ¦, are highly developed; there
are openings (stigmata) at the sides of the body which draw in air by means of the
active participation of the muscles of the body. The number of stigmata varies
between two and ten pairs; the tracheÃ¦ themselves branch off from the trunks in
the most varied manner, and carry air to the internal organs.</p>

<p>The colourless <span class="lowercase smcap">BLOOD</span> circulates between the tissues and organs, and is kept
circulating by the contraction of a chambered dorsal vessel provided with ostia,
and which terminates in a short aorta opening at the anterior end.</p>

<p>Insects are <span class="lowercase smcap">SEXUALLY DISTINCT</span>; their sexual glands are in pairs and have a
tubular structure, but the testicular tubules are united together by a capsule into an
oval testicle; exceptionally, also, the excretory canals are double, as also the sexual
orifices; usually the paired canals unite into a single oviduct or spermatic duct
which terminates at the posterior end of the body after receiving the products of
various glands.</p>

<p>As to the <span class="lowercase smcap">HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT</span> of insects, all that is necessary to
mention here is that the young hatched from eggs only exceptionally (as in
<i>Apterygota</i>) resemble the adult parent (insecta ametabola); as a rule they differ
from them not only in the shape of the body, but also more or less by their manner
of life, and only attain the form of the parent through <span class="lowercase smcap">METAMORPHOSIS</span>. This is a
gradual process (insecta hemimetabola) in the <i>Rhynchota</i> and <i>Orthoptera</i>, or a
sudden one with a stage of inanition (insecta metabola) in the other orders. This
stage of rest or inanition, the <span class="lowercase smcap">PUPA</span>, concludes the larval life (caterpillar, maggot,<span class="pagenum" title="531"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531"></a></span>
etc.); during the pupal stage no nourishment at all is taken, but the internal
organs undergo changes; in some forms the rest is not absolute, as voluntary
local movements may take place (pupÃ¦ of gnats).</p>

<p>The insects are divided into numerous orders according to the form of the
mouth parts, the structure of the wings, as well as the manner of the development;
with the exception of the lowest group (<i>Apterygota</i>), which is most nearly related to
the ancestors of the insects, and which has no wings and undergoes no metamorphosis,
all the remaining orders, which are termed <i>Pterygota</i>, have wings on the thorax,
though there are, of course, a few species and families of this group which have lost
their wings.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The bed bugs live in the cracks and fissures of human habitations, under carpets,
behind pictures, in furniture, bedsteads, etc.; hidden during the day, they attack
persons at night to suck their blood. The alkaline secretion of the salivary glands
dropped into the wound around the separate bites causes the so-called âwheals.â</p>

<p>The bed bugs were known in bygone days by the Greeks (Îºá½±ÏÎ¹Î¿) and the Romans
(cimex). They were first mentioned from Strasburg in the eleventh century, and
in England about 1500.</p>

<p>[This is the common bed bug of northern latitudes and must not be confused with
the tropical bed bug (<i>C. rotundatus</i>). The bed bug can migrate from one house to
another; this especially takes place when a house is uninhabited. They escape
from windows and pass along walls, water-pipes and gutters, and so reach adjoining
houses. This noxious pest accompanies man wherever he goes; ships and trains
become infested, especially the former.</p>

<p>[A characteristic feature in this animal is the peculiar odour it produces, like
many others in the same group of insects. This odour comes from a clear, oily
volatile liquid secreted by glands in various parts of the body. Although the normal
food is manâs blood, the bed bug can subsist upon moist wood, dust and dirt that
collects in crevices in floors, walls, furniture, etc. The puncturing mouth consists of
a fleshy under lip, within which lie four thread-like hard filaments which pierce the
flesh, the blood being drawn up through the beak.</p>

<p>[The eggs are oval, white, with a projecting rim around one end, with a lid which
is pushed off when the young hatch; they are laid in cracks and crevices in batches
of from twelve to fifty. The egg stage lasts from seven to ten days. The larval
stage so gradually passes into the adult that one scarcely notices the change;
during its growth the skin is cast five times, and at the change the little wing-pads
are seen, showing that the adult stage is reached. The young larva is at first pale
yellowish-white. It resembles the parent, but has no trace of elytra. Although
eleven weeks is said to be necessary for their development, the stages may be gone
through much more rapidly; Howard and Marlatt<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> give seven weeks in some
instances. It seems pretty certain that these Cimex only take one meal of blood
between each moult and another preceding egg laying.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p></div>

<p class="spec"><b>Cimex rotundatus</b>, Signoret, 1852.</p>

<p>[This bug is common in warm climates; it is an abundant insect
in India, and King has found it in the Sudan, where <i>C. lectularius</i> is,
however, the common species. It is usually known as the tropical
bed bug. Signoretâs bug can be told from the other common species
by the shape of the pronotum. In <i>C. rotundatus</i> it is uniformly
convex, whilst in <i>C. lectularius</i> the lateral edges are flat and sometimes
even concave. The abdomen of <i>rotundatus</i> is also rather more
elongate.</p>

<p>[This species is of considerable importance, as according to Patton
it may act partly as the intermediary host of the piroplasma of
kala-azar.</p>

<p>[Wenyon found at Bagdad that <i>Cimex</i> sp. would take up Leishmania
from Oriental sore, and that the parasite developed into flagellate
form. Patton came to the conclusion that the bed bug transmitted
Oriental sore in Cambay, India, but Wenyon contests this view
(<i>vide Journ. Lond. School Trop. Med.</i>, 1912, ii, pt. 1, pp.&nbsp;13â26).
Franchini (<i>Bull. Soc. Path, exot.</i>, 1912, v, No. 10, pp.&nbsp;817â819)
was unable to connect Cimex with this disease. At present nothing
seems proved. Besides their possible connection with kala-azar, it
has been shown by Howard and Clark (<i>Journ. Exp. Med.</i>, 1912, xvi,
No. 6, pp.&nbsp;850â859) that they can carry the virus of poliomyelitis.</p>

<p>[This bed bug was originally described from the Island of RÃ©union

Fieber, in 1861, as <i>C. macrocephalus</i>. This is the same as Signoretâs

on the pronotum, and six red lateral lines on the abdomen, black legs,
head and beak. The insect is figured in a coloured plate (No. 9) in
<i>Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz</i>, 1909, i, fasc. 2, pp.&nbsp;158â218.</p>

<p class="spec"><b>Conorhinus sanguisuga</b>, Lec. (Blood-sucking Cone-nose).</p>

<p>This bug is also known as the Texas or Mexican bed bug, also as
the big bed bug. It is particularly troublesome in the Mississippi
Valley in bedrooms. The bite is very severe and results in more
pronounced swelling and inflammation than that of the Cimex.<span class="pagenum" title="538"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538"></a></span>
Normally this genus feeds upon the blood of mammals and insects.
Its fondness for human blood appears to be quite a new habit, and
appears limited to the mature insect only. It is nearly an inch long,
flat, head very narrow and long, the rostrum short and thick. In
colour it is dark brown with pink markings. They are fully winged
when adult, and they fly with ease, entering houses on the wing,
especially being attracted by lights in windows; they also run swiftly.
Like the bed bug they conceal themselves during the day and come
out at night and bite the sleeper. The effect of the bite is very varied,
but as a rule a sore, itching wound, accompanied by burning pain
and swellings, which may extend over a good deal of the body, occur.
A specific poison is undoubtedly injected into the puncture; but no
doubt serious results are also due to the beak being contaminated
through the insects feeding upon foul carrion. Mr. Lembert, when
bitten by a <i>Conorhinus</i> sp. (?) on the Pacific slope, exhibited the
following symptoms: an itching sensation extending up the leg,
large blotches manifesting themselves on the upper part of the
limb and extending up to the hands and arms; his lips swelled
and the itching and swelling extended over the head; there was
also much nausea. Similar results are recorded from other regions.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></p>

<p>The eggs of the <i>C. sanguisuga</i> are at first white, then become
yellow, then pink; the young hatch in twenty days. There are two
larval and two pupal stages, the latter showing wing-pads. The eggs
are laid and the young feed out of doors, chiefly upon insects. It is
particularly abundant in April and May indoors.</p>

as inflicting âa very nasty sting, which is done by the huge proboscis.â
Acute pain and inflammation follow in a few minutes. In one case
the whole leg became swollen. This species occurs over the whole
Oriental region, in Madagascar and Sierra Leone. It is dark brown
in colour with dusky yellow or brick-red markings on the pronotum
and elytra. Donovan suggests that it may be connected with the
kala-azar piroplasma.</p>

(Great Black Bug of Pampas).</p>

<p>This large black bug is mentioned by Darwin,<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> who states as
follows: âAt night I experienced an attack (for it deserves no less
a name) of the benchuca, a species of Reduvius, the great black
bug of the Pampas. It is most disgusting to feel soft wingless
insects, about an inch long, crawling over oneâs body. Before sucking
they are quite thin, but afterwards they become round and
bloated with blood, and in this state are easily crushed. One which
I caught at Iquique (for they are found in Chili and Peru) was very
empty. When placed on a table, and though surrounded by people,
if a finger was presented the bold insect would immediately protrude
its sucker, make a charge and, if allowed, draw blood. No pain was
caused by the wound. It was curious to watch its body during the
action of sucking, as in less than ten minutes it changed from being
flat as a wafer to a globular form. This one feast, for which the
benchuca was indebted to one of the officers, kept it fat during four
whole months, but after the first fortnight it was quite ready to have
another suck.â Mr. Kirby<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> also refers to this species.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ of beetles, similarly to those of some other <i>Arthropoda</i> (myriapods
and the larvÃ¦ of gnats), have sometimes been observed in man as purely accidental
guests. In one case or another, such accounts may have originated through a
mistake of the observer. Thus English doctors report the presence of the larvÃ¦ of
<i>Blaps mortisaga</i> in the stools of human beings, Sandberg of the larva of <i>Agrypnus
murinus</i> in his ten year old son, and Blanchard mentions the larva of a beetle that
was vomited by a child. All these cases, however, do not represent actual parasitism,

<p>Wingless, the thoracic rings distinct and free; antennÃ¦ of three segments; legs
very powerful; abdomen with nine segments. [Ten segments are present, but only
nine are visible.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.] The mandibles transformed into serrated puncturing
organs, which are situated in the split sheath of the rostrum; the maxillÃ¦ are
laminated and have palpi, and more or less conceal the other parts.</p>

<p>The importance of fleas lies mainly in the fact that they act as plague carriers.
About 150 species have already been described. The only ones of importance for
this work are those found on man and those on rats and mice. The two families
in which these are found are known as <i>PulicidÃ¦</i> and <i>SarcopsyllidÃ¦</i>.</p>

<p>The eggs of fleas are laid on the ground, on rugs, etc., and in birdsâ and rodentsâ
nests. They hatch rapidly in warm weather and in warm climates, varying from
two to five days; in cold countries they may take two or three weeks to incubate.</p>

<p>The larva is a footless creature, pearly white in colour, the head sometimes
being darkened, composed of fourteen segments including the head, and although
apodal can move with considerable agility. It lives amongst dust and dirt, and
feeds upon any organic matter it can find. In about two weeks it is said to become
mature, and then spins a cocoon in which pupation takes place.</p>

<p>The cocoons of the common human flea and the fowl flea become covered with
dust and dirt. The period of pupal life seems varied, for I have had the fowl flea
hatch out in ten days, and others in three weeks at the same time of year.</p>

<p>The adults are blood suckers and cause considerable irritation as well as
acting as disease carriers, and in the <i>SarcopsyllidÃ¦</i> the females attach themselves
permanently to their hosts, embedding themselves under the skin, where they
become pregnant. Some kinds harbour the cystic stage of tapeworms, and the rat
trypanosome passes certain stages in the rat flea. Most fleas have definite hosts,
but some, like the rat and fowl fleas, attack man.</p>

<p>The fleas which can carry the bacillus of plague are <i>Xenopsylla cheopis</i>, <i>Pulex
irritans</i>, <i>Ceratophyllus fasciatus</i> and <i>Hoplopsyllus anomalus</i>.</p>

<p>The sand flea (nigua) particularly infests Central and South America, and,
in 1873, was carried by ships from Brazil to the West Coast of Africa. In a comparatively
short time it has become disseminated throughout Africa and has also
appeared in Madagascar; recently also it has been reported from China.</p>

<p>Besides attacking man, it also settles on mammals, for instance, on dogs, pigs,
etc. According to Jullien the wound or little swelling caused by the female has no
particular significance, as children infested with ten or eleven sand fleas quietly
proceeded with their games. It will be understood, however, that the wound easily
affords the opportunity for the setting up of inflammation or even septic processes,

<p>This is apparently the chief plague flea. The Indian Plague
Committee have proved that this flea is easily infected when fed on
plague rats, and that the bacillus multiplies rapidly in the fleaâs
stomach and that the fleas may remain infective for fifteen days. How
the flea infects man does not apparently seem to have been proved, as
it does not do so through its bite, but the excrement is highly infective.

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mosquitoes come in the <i>Nematocera</i>, one of the sub-orders of the <i>Diptera</i>,
and are divided into numerous families, of which, however, the <i>CulicidÃ¦</i> are of most
interest to us here. Other families as the <i>PsychodidÃ¦</i> and <i>ChironomidÃ¦</i> are also
of considerable importance, <i>vide</i> following pages. The head is small, the facetted
eyes are placed laterally, but there are no accessory eyes (ocelli). In front of the
eyes are situated the comparatively long antennÃ¦, the differences of which strongly
mark the distinction of sex.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></p>

<p>The antennÃ¦ are composed of fifteen or sixteen segments. In the male they
are covered with long whorl-like hairs, while in the female the antennal hairs are
short&mdash;differences that are perceptible even with the naked eye.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> The proboscis,
which is longer than the antennÃ¦, protrudes from the inferior aspect of the head and
is composed of the following parts (figs.&nbsp;387 and 388): Two grooved half tubes,
facing one another, of which the upper one is the upper lip (labrum) and the lower
one the lower lip (labium), which represents a pair of coalesced maxillÃ¦. Within
the tube formed by the labrum and labium are the mandibles and maxillÃ¦, transformed
into instruments for piercing, and a single puncturing organ, the hypopharynx.
On the right and left, next to the proboscis, are placed the straight five-jointed
palpi, the final joint of which is thickened in the male.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> In biting, the
labrum, which is swollen at its free end, is not introduced into the wound like the<span class="pagenum" title="549"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549"></a></span>
other mouth parts, but is bent backwards. The labium and hypopharynx push
direct into the skin; the maxillÃ¦ and mandibles, however, which are needle-like and
serrated at the tips, penetrate with a saw-like movement. [The swollen free end of
the labrum really means the <i>labellÃ¦</i>, two articulated pieces, supposed by some to be
the labial palpi. In most species the mandibles are not serrated at their ends.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]
The saliva is introduced into the wound through the lumen of the
hypopharynx, while the blood is sucked up by the mosquito in the groove of the
labium.</p>

<p>The three thoracic segments are soldered together. The central one carries the
membranous wings on the sides of the dorsal surface; the posterior somite carries
the small halteres (rudimentary posterior wings). There are three pairs of long
slender legs on the lower side.</p></div>

<p>The pair of salivary glands have one common excretory duct leading into the
hypopharynx.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 389.</span>&mdash;Longitudinal section of an Anopheles, showing alimentary canal. In the forepart
of the thorax is the salivary gland consisting of three tubules; ventrally, the suctorial stomach
extending into the abdominal cavity; the stomach, and at the posterior end of the abdomen
the Malpighian vessels. (After Grassi.)</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These glandular bodies are situated in the thorax; each consists of three slightly
serpentine tubules, the dorsal and ventral tubes being long, the central one shorter.
The above-named characteristics apply to both genera Culex and Anopheles, but in
the genus Culex is smaller, Anopheles larger. [In Anopheles the ends of the ducts
in the lobules are dilated, whilst in most of the genera the ducts are the same
size all along. The lobules may bifurcate, and in Psorophora there are five lobules.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]
The legs of the genus Culex are about the same length as the whole body;
in Anopheles they are double that length.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> In Anopheles the palpi and proboscis are
of equal length; in Culex the condition is different, according to sex. In the male
the palpi are longer than the proboscis; in the female considerably shorter and the
number of segments diminished. The venation of the wings exhibits further points of
differentiation, as also their adornment, though this last sign is not by any means
always conclusive; most species of the genus Culex have unspotted wings, whilst
those of Anopheles are usually spotted. More important is the fact that in Culex the
abdomen is decorated with small scales, similar to those on butterflies, whereas
there are small bristles on the abdomen of Anopheles. [This cannot be said to be a
character by which an Anopheline may be told from a Culicine, for in such common
Anopheline genera as Cellia and Neocellia we get plenty of scales on the abdomen.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]
An experienced observer can, however, separate the two genera by the
difference in size and their manner of resting. When settled they either touch the
resting place with all the legs or only with the four anterior legs. In consequence
of the different length of the legs, the body of Culex approaches the resting place
more closely; moreover, Culex holds the abdomen parallel or at an acute angle to
the resting surface, whereas Anopheles carries the abdomen directed upwards (at an
angle of about 145Â°) and holds the head down. Both genera, however, usually only
rest on the four anterior legs, and then, as has long been known, Culex carries the
third pair directed towards the dorsum, while those of Anopheles hang down.</p>

<p>In regard to the differentiation of the species, I must refer you to the special
literature, and content myself by observing that about 150 species of Culex and
about fifty species of Anopheles have been described, of which fifty about four are<span class="pagenum" title="552"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552"></a></span>
found in Europe. [The number of known Anophelines now is more&mdash;100 species&mdash;of
other CulicidÃ¦ over 700.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.] According to our present knowledge it
appears that the entire genus Anopheles can transmit malaria to man; this observation
has been confirmed in <i>Anopheles claviger</i>, Fabr.; <i>A. maculipennis</i>, Meig.;
<i>A. bifurcatus</i>, L.; <i>A. superpictus</i>, Grassi; <i>A. pseudopictus</i>, Gr., all of which are
found in Italy,<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> Germany, etc., as well as in the tropics. Moreover, in <i>A. costalis</i>,
Loew; <i>A. funestus</i>, Giles (Africa); <i>A. quadrimaculatus</i>, Say (North America), and
<i>A. rossii</i>, Giles; the latter is perhaps identical with <i>A. superpictus</i>, Gr., as well as
with <i>A. culicifacies</i> (India). [<i>Anopheles maculipennis</i> and <i>A. claviger</i> are the same.
Certainly neither <i>maculipennis</i> nor <i>bifurcatus</i> has been found in the tropics.
<i>Anopheles quadrimaculatus</i>, Say, is the same as <i>A. maculipennis</i>. There is no
evidence that <i>all</i> Anophelines carry malaria, but there is much to show that certain
species only are capable of so doing. A list of known carriers is given later.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p></div>

<p>Everyone is aware that mosquitoes swarm at sunset in fine weather, and then
seek out human beings and other warm-blooded animals to take food. In this
regard, however, the sexes differ, for it is almost without exception that the females
only suck blood, while the males subsist on the juices of plants (blossoms or fruits).<span class="pagenum" title="553"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553"></a></span><a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a>
After sucking, and when night has fallen, the mosquitoes find a place of refuge, for
which purpose they utilize the grasses or foliage of trees and bushes, or inhabited or
uninhabited rooms of houses, also cellars, stables, verandahs, etc., where they also
pass the day.</p>

<p>[Some mosquitoes bite in the daytime&mdash;Stegoymia and some Anophelines; some
bite right into the night, as <i>Culex fatigans</i> and <i>C. pipiens</i>.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

<p>The period required for digestion varies according to the temperature. It takes
two days in summer, and may take up to ten days or more in cool weather. After
digestion is complete more food is taken up, this being necessary [in some species
only&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.] for the maturing of the sexual products in the female.</p></div>

<p>It is still unknown under what circumstances copulation takes place;<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> in any
case, sooner or later the females are fecundated, and when the ova have become
mature, and the season is not too far advanced, they seek a suitable place in which
to deposit them.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> These are larger or smaller, permanent or temporary, collections
of standing water, pools, puddles, lakes, pits, water in rain-water barrels, basins, etc.
Nevertheless, certain kinds prefer certain waters; thus <i>Anopheles</i> (<i>claviger</i>) <i>maculipennis</i>
and several of the Culices seek stagnant water overgrown with swamp vegetation
and decomposing vegetable matter; <i>A. bifurcatus</i> and certain Culices, clear
water with some vegetation (such as fountains and the lakes in gardens and parks);
<i>Culex pipiens</i> has a preference for rain-water barrels, even though the water be dirty
and evil-smelling. [I have found the larvÃ¦ of <i>Anopheles bifurcatus</i> living in great
numbers in ponds and lakes completely overgrown with floating water-weeds, and
those of <i>Culex pipiens</i> in liquid manure.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="554"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554"></a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Sexual Organs of the Mosquito.</i>&mdash;The female has a pair of ovaries, opening into
a single tube by the ovarian tubes; into the single tube opens a duct coming from
the spermathecÃ¦, and also a mucous gland. The spermathecÃ¦ store up the male
cells. The male organs consist of two testes joined by ducts (vasa deferentia) to the
ejaculatory duct formed by their union. Each vas deferens is joined by a short tube
with the sac-like vesicula seminalis.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

<p>There is also a difference in the manner in which Culex and Anopheles deposit
their ova. Culex deposits two to three hundred eggs in compact heaps that float
on the water, and in which the eggs stand perpendicularly one next the other;
whereas <i>Anopheles maculipennis</i> deposits only three or four up to twenty eggs,
united in groups that float horizontally on the water; the eggs of <i>A. bifurcatus</i>,
again, are arranged in star-like groups. The eggs are about 0Â·75&nbsp;mm. in length,
and assume a dark hue soon after being laid. The development only occupies a
few days. The young larvÃ¦ grow rapidly, changing their integument several times;
the larvÃ¦ also differ in the various genera, though they have a general resemblance
(figs.&nbsp;391 and 392).</p>

<p>The long legless larva has a flattened head, a fairly broad, rectangular, or
trapeziform thorax, on which there are bristles, and an abdomen distinctly segmented,
and on the segments of which there are also lateral bristles. The situation
of the stigmata marks the difference between the two genera. Though in both
genera the stigmata are at the posterior end and on the dorsal surface, they are in
Anopheles close to the surface of the body; in Culex, however, they are on the free
end of a long tube (siphon).</p></div>

Enlarged. (After Grassi.)</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The position of the larva in the water also differs. The larva of Anopheles lies
almost horizontally beneath the surface of the water, the posterior border of the
penultimate abdominal segment, upon which the stigmata are situated, being on the
surface; whereas the larva of Culex hangs head downwards perpendicularly in the
water, the point of the siphon only touching the surface.</p>

<p>In about a fortnight the larva is fully grown and becomes a pupa. The pupa<span class="pagenum" title="555"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555"></a></span>
(fig.&nbsp;393), which moves in jerky movements, remains in the water, but partakes of
no food. In shape it somewhat resembles a tadpole, that is to say, it consists of a
bulky anterior portion, on the surface of which the head, with its appendages, is
recognizable, and a more slender segmented abdomen. Above, on the thorax, there
are two small trumpet-shaped breathing tubes for the conveyance of air to the
tracheal system. After three or four days the perfect mosquito hatches out, remains
a short time on the surface of the water until its chitinous integument is hardened,
and then flies away.</p>

<p>The females that are fertilized in the autumn hibernate in sheltered spots in the
open air, or in houses, cellars, under stairs, in stables, barns, etc., and are the
progenitors of the first generation of the following year.</p>

<p>In accordance with the climate of a country, or the kind of weather of a year,
the conditions in regard to the manner of life and the duration of the development
of the mosquito vary. At all events, the life-history of the mosquito elucidates
many points relating to malaria which were hitherto not understood.</p>

<p>[The length of the egg, larval and pupal life varies so much that it is not
possible to give an account of any value here. Frequently the eggs may incubate
in two days, whilst I have had <i>Stegomyia fasciata</i> eggs from Cuba that have hatched
out under abnormal circumstances more than two months after they were laid
(âMono. Culicid.,â iii, p.&nbsp;6). Some larvÃ¦, as <i>Anopheles bifurcatus</i>, live for
months during the winter. Some mosquitoes therefore hibernate as larvÃ¦. The
larvÃ¦ and pupÃ¦ of the different genera present very marked characters, mainly in
regard to the structure of the siphons. Specific differences may be found in the
frontal hairs of Anopheline larvÃ¦ and in the number and arrangement of a group
of spines at the base of the siphon in Culicines.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p></div>


<p class="ph2">CulicidÃ¦ or Mosquitoes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The importance of these insects to man is very great. They not only produce
painful bites, which may become inflamed and give rise to a considerable amount
of Ådema, but they are more important on account of the part they play in the
distribution of various diseases. <i>CulicidÃ¦</i> may not only carry disease germs, but
act as intermediate hosts for certain parasites, such as some of the <i>Anophelina</i> for
malarial parasites, Culex for FilariÃ¦, and Stegomyia for yellow fever, etc.; the last-named
is in any case the distributor of that fatal disease. It is therefore very
necessary to know the life-history, habits and characters of these pests.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes exist in almost all parts of the world from the Arctic circle to the
tropics; temperate regions suffer from them less than the two extremes, but even
there they form not only a source of great annoyance but of danger as malaria and
possibly now and again yellow fever carriers. A few years ago comparatively few
species were known, now some 800 odd have been described. Their number will
probably not stop far short of 1,000, in spite of the fact that many have been
described under different names, yet really the same species. Some are purely
domestic, others entirely sylvan; the former, as we might expect, often have a very
wide distribution, having been taken from place to place in boats and trains. The
more rapid transport becomes, the greater becomes the possibility of this wide
distribution of many species increasing, and the spread of other species from their
natural home to foreign parts by sea and then by trains further inland.</p>

<p>All <i>CulicidÃ¦</i> are aquatic in their larval and pupal stages. Almost all small
collections of water, both natural and artificial, may form breeding grounds for
these pests. Some even breed in pitcher plants and many in bromelias. The<span class="pagenum" title="556"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556"></a></span><span class="pagenum hide" title="557"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557"></a></span>
favourite resorts for the larvÃ¦ of Anophelina are small natural collections of water,
such as puddles, ditches and small pools around swamps; certain species (<i>A. maculipennis</i>,
etc.) live in rain barrels as well. They may also occur in the sluggish water
at the edges of rivers or even in mid river, where the flow is checked by masses
of water weeds (<i>Myzomyia funesta</i>, etc.). The Stegomyias prefer artificial collections
of water, but also occur in natural pools. The yellow fever species (<i>S. fasciata</i>)
prefers small collections, such as in barrels, pots, jars, etc. Culex occur in all
manner of places&mdash;rain barrels, tanks, cisterns, ponds and ditches. Some of the
South American species of Culex, Wyeomyia, Joblotia, etc., breed in the collections
of water at the base of bromelia leaves.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> Very few Culicid larvÃ¦ live in salt water
except in Australia, where Dr. Bancroft has found them in salt water of specific
gravity 1Â·040 (<i>Mucidus alternans</i> and <i>Culex annulirostris</i>). Other salt water
mosquitoes are known in America. The food of the larvÃ¦ is very varied; the
majority appear to feed upon confervÃ¦, small crustacea and insects; some are
cannibals, readily devouring others of their own kind. The larger larvÃ¦ of Megarhinus,
Psorophora, Toxorhynchites and Mucidus are extremely ravenous and devour
one another.</p></div>

<p>There are two main types of larvÃ¦, the Anopheline and Culicine; in the former
there is no respiratory siphon, in the latter the siphon is long or moderately long.
The head offers certain marked peculiarities which are of specific value; this
especially applies to the <i>Anophelina</i>, in which the frontal hairs are of great service
in distinguishing the larvÃ¦,<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> whilst in Culex the number and position of the spines
at the base of and on the siphon are characteristic. The position assumed by the
larvÃ¦ in the water also varies in the different groups; most of the Anophelines lie
horizontally, most of the <i>Culicina</i> and <i>Ãdeomyina</i> hang head downwards. The<span class="pagenum" title="558"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558"></a></span>
pupÃ¦ also vary, but not to the same extent; the chief differences to be noticed are
in the form of the two respiratory trumpets.</p></div>

<p>The eggs, which may be laid separately (<i>Anopheles maculipennis</i>, <i>Stegomyia

<p><i>Scales</i>.&mdash;The most important structural peculiarities in <i>CulicidÃ¦</i> are the scales,
which form the chief and most readily observed characters for separating genera
and species. The importance of scale structure has been recently ignored by some
workers, who are probably right academically, but as a means of separating groups,
and so more easily running down a species, the practical man is strongly advised to
follow this method. As to what a genus is, is purely a matter of personal opinion.
If one examines any recent standard work on entomology one will find a species
being placed in varied genera by the varied authorities.</p>

<p>The head, thorax, abdomen and wings are in nearly all cases clothed with
squamÃ¦ of varied form, of which the following are the main types (fig.&nbsp;397)<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>(1) Flat, spade-shaped scales (<i>a</i>).<br />
(2) Narrow curved scales (<i>e</i>).<br />

(4) Spindle-shaped scales (<i>f</i>).<br />
(5) Small spindle-shaped scales (<i>g</i>).<br />

(7) Twisted upright scales (<i>j</i>).<br />
(8) Inflated or pyriform scales (<i>k</i>).<span class="pagenum" title="561"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561"></a></span><br />
(9) Mansonia scales (<i>b</i>).<br />
(10) Small broad asymmetrical scales (<i>c</i>).</p>

<p>(1) Narrow linear lateral scales.<br />
(2) Narrow lanceolate scales.<br />
(3) Broad lanceolate scales.<br />
(4) Elongated, broad, truncated scales (= PseudotÃ¦niorhynchus-like scales).<br />

(6) Asymmetrical broad or TÃ¦niorhynchus scales.<br />
(7) Flat spade-like scales.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></p>

<p>The wings have a series of scales along the middle line of the veins, and also
lateral scales to all or nearly all the veins. The wing is also fringed by a series of
scales (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_396">396</a>), which, however, are of little systematic importance; the so-called
âborder scalesâ (b.s.) vary, however, to some extent, and are useful characters in

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 399.</span>&mdash;Wing of <i>Anopheles maculipennis</i>, Meigen.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This genus contains a few large species found either in temperate climates or
in hills and mountains of warm climates. The type is the European and North
American <i>A. maculipennis</i>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>A. maculipennis</i>, Meigen. This species and <i>A. bifurcatus</i> are malaria carriers.
True Anopheles only occur in Europe, North America, the North of Africa and in
the mountains of India, and one has been found by Bancroft similar to <i>A. bifurcatus</i>
in Queensland. They are easily told by the absence of scales on thorax
and abdomen, and by the rather densely scaled wings with lanceolate scales.</p></div>

1910, iii, p.&nbsp;24; v, p.&nbsp;16, Theobald.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This genus occurs in Asia, Africa and South America, Europe and East Indies.
The type is <i>M. funesta</i>, Giles, found in Central and West Africa. Although structurally
there is not much difference between this genus and Anopheles, they differ
greatly in appearance, and there are usually a few narrow curved thoracic scales
projecting over the head, whilst the wing scales are much smaller in proportion, and
the wings more uniformly spotted, always so along the costa. <i>Funesta</i> and <i>lutzii</i>
are undoubtedly malaria bearers and also <i>rossii</i>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A single species only occurs in this genus, <i>N. elegans</i>, James, from India. In
this genus, which is near to Myzomyia, the fourth long vein is very near the base
of the third, and there are outstanding scales on the prothoracic lobes, and there is
a marked tuft of dense scales at the posterior angles of the head.</p></div>


<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Cycloleppteron</b>, Theobald.</p>

<p class="syn">âMono. Culicid.,â 1903, ii, p.&nbsp;312; 1903, iii, p.&nbsp;58; 1910, v, p.&nbsp;33.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Two common species only occur in this genus, <i>C. grabhamii</i>, Theob., from
Jamaica, and <i>C. mediopunctatus</i>, Theob. (Lutz., ms.), from South America. The
chief character is the presence of large black inflated pyriform scales on the wings.
The palpi are densely scaled. Neither have been shown to be malaria bearers.</p></div>

<p class="spec"><b>Stegomyia fasciata</b>, Fabricius (Yellow Fever Mosquito).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This insect, which is the proven carrier of yellow fever, is commonly called the
tiger, brindled, spotted day or striped mosquito. It is also referred to by some
writers as <i>S. calopus</i>, Meigen. It is subject to considerable variation in colour,
but the thoracic markings are generally very constant. The general colour is
almost black to deep brown, the head with a median white area, white at the sides
and in front around the eyes; the thorax has two median parallel yellow lines,
a broad curved silvery one on each side and white spots at the sides; the scales on
the intervening spaces of the thorax are brown. The dark abdomen has basal white
bands and basal white lateral spots. The dark legs have basal white bands, the
last segment of the hind legs being all white except in a variety from South America
and the West Indies (<i>luciensis</i>), which has the tip of the last hind tarsal dark. The
abdomen may also vary in colour, some having pale scales over most of the surface
(<i>queenslandensis</i>).</p>

<p>The food of the adult female consists mainly of manâs blood, but she will also
feed on dogs and other animals. The male has been said to bite, but such is very
unusual. This mosquito bites mainly in the daytime up till about 5&nbsp;p.m.</p>

<p>The adults breed the first day after emergence. They may live a considerable
time, Bancroft having kept females for two months in confinement. The
ova are laid separately, often in chains; they are black, oval, with a reticulated
membrane outside, some of the reticulated cells containing air. They may hatch
in from six to twenty hours, the larval stage nine days, the pupal stage three; thus
the whole cycle may be completed in from twelve to thirteen days. The ova when
dry can remain undeveloped for a considerable time. The larvÃ¦ are greyish-white,
with short, thick siphon, and feed at the bottom of the water, only coming to
the surface now and again to breathe. This is almost entirely a domesticated
gnat, seldom being found far from manâs habitations. Its larvÃ¦ occur in such
small collections of water as old sardine tins, jam-pots, calabashes, puddles, barrels,
wells&mdash;in fact, wherever water is held up, even to the gutters of houses. Not
only are they found breeding on land, but also on board ship, although they
prefer artificial collections of water. They may also breed in larger natural
collections.</p>

<p>This insect is easily transported by steam and sailing ships and by train, and
this doubtless explains its very wide distribution. The adults may live for fifty
days, and it is on this account and their frequent occurrence on ships that danger
lies in regard to the Panama Canal. An infected insect may leave that endemic
centre of yellow fever and live until the vessel arrived at the Philippine Islands and
fly ashore, and so introduce the disease for the native <i>fasciata</i> possibly to spread.</p>

<p>Roughly the distribution of this pest is as follows: Africa from South to North,
but especially along the coast and up the Nile. In Asia, in India, Ceylon, Burma,
Siam, along the ports of the Malay Peninsula, in French Cochin China, Philippine
Islands, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Japan, Malay Archipelago, and East
Indies, Turkey in Asia, Arabia and Palestine.</p>

<p>In Australia it occurs in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South
Australia.</p>

<p>In Europe in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, in the Mediterranean Islands.</p>

<p>In South America, Central America, Mexico, North America, and the West
Indies it is very abundant, and it also is found in the Bahama Islands, Fiji, Sandwich
Islands, Samoa, the Azores, Teneriffe and Santa Cruz, Pitcairn Islands and Bermuda.</p>

<p>For a full account of its distribution the reader is referred to the following:

dâEntomologie, 1911, ii, pp.&nbsp;145â170, F.&nbsp;V. Theobald.â In addition to being the
yellow fever carrier, it is supposed by Wenyon to be the intermediate host of the
parasite of Bagdad sore.</p></div>


<p class="spec"><b>Stegomyia scutellaris</b>, Walker.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A vicious biter, found in India, China, Malay, East Indies, and Ceylon. The

<p>A very similar species occurs in Fiji, but can be told by the pleurÃ¦ having white
lines, not spots (<i>S. pseudoscutellaris</i>, Theobald). It is the intermediate host of

occur in rain barrels and small pools. It is essentially a domestic form, occurring in
houses and privies. Its distribution is Europe generally and North America. The
bite is very severe, and in some districts gives rise to painful Ådema.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<p>This large genus still contains many forms which should be excluded. The
species normally have narrow curved median head-scales, and similar ones on the
scutellum; the female palpi are shorter than in the former genus and the male
palpi are pointed; the lateral vein-scales are narrow and linear.</p></div>

<p>The type is <i>Culex pipiens</i>, Linn., the common gnat of Europe. The thorax
is covered with narrow curved golden-brown scales, the abdomen has basal pale
bands to the segments and the legs and proboscis are unbanded. The stem of the
first submarginal cell is always less than one-fifth the length of the cell. It lays its
eggs in rafts in water-butts, etc., and even in the foulest water. They are first
deposited in England in June and July, and again soon after hatching in August. In
some districts this gnat bites man viciously, in others not at all.</p>

<p>The common tropical gnat (<i>Culex fatigans</i>, Wied). This resembles the
European <i>Culex pipiens</i>, but can always be told by the stem of the first submarginal
cell always being much longer than it is in <i>C. pipiens</i>. This is one of the species
that has been proved to transmit filariÃ¦ to man, etc. Varieties of it occur in almost
every country between 40Â° N. and S., having a very similar range to <i>S. fasciata</i>. In

<p>The black mosquito, <i>Melanoconion atratus</i>, Theob. This small gnat is a very
troublesome pest in swamps in the West Indies. The female bites both by day and

It is almost black in colour, but sometimes presents a dull coppery sheen; each
segment has small lateral basal white spots. Length 2Â·5 to 3&nbsp;mm.</p>

<p class="ph2">Other Nematocera.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Other nematocerous flies are midges, daddy-long-legs and sand-flies. The ones
which cause annoyance to man besides <i>CulicidÃ¦</i> are the <span class="nowrap">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sand-flies (<i>SimulidÃ¦</i>), certain midges (<i>ChironomidÃ¦</i>), and a few owl midges
(<i>PsychodidÃ¦</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>Nematocera</i> have long thread-like jointed antennÃ¦ and their pupÃ¦ are, as a
rule, naked; the larvÃ¦ have a distinct head and can thus be told from the next
section (<i>Brachycera</i>).</p></div>


<p class="spec">Family. <b>SimulidÃ¦.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This family consists of a single genus, Simulium, Latreille, which Roubaud has
recently divided into two sub-genera called Pro-Simulium and Eu-Simulium. These
insects, which are frequently spoken of as sand-flies, are found in all parts of the
world; they are all small insects varying from 1Â·5 to 3&nbsp;mm. The females are very
bloodthirsty, but the males appear to be incapable of sucking blood.</p>

<p>The head sunk under the humped thorax; antennÃ¦ short, straight; palpi short<span class="pagenum" title="578"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578"></a></span>
and broad, of four segments, bent; wings broad and in some iridescent, legs stout.
The male has holoptic eyes, whilst in the female they are small and widely separate.
The sucking proboscis is short. The thorax and abdomen are clothed with short
hairs which may form spots and markings; these are golden, silvery, grey, or brownish.
In the sub-genus Pro-Simulium the second segment of the hind tarsi in both
sexes is elongate, linear, and without a basal notch; in Eu-Simulium it is short,
curved, and dorsally notched at the base.</p>

<p><i>SimulidÃ¦</i> often occur in swarms, and attack not only man but cattle, horses,
and poultry. In some districts they are more annoying than mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Their life-cycle has been most completely worked out by King, in Africa.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ and pupÃ¦ occur in swiftly flowing water, by waterfalls, in rapids, etc.
The ova are laid in gelatinous masses on plants or rocks close to or overhanging the
water. The larva is cylindrical, enlarged posteriorly, where it is provided with a
sucker, by means of which it attaches itself to a rock, water weeds, debris, etc.;
anteriorly it has a proleg close behind the head on the lower surface. The head is
dark and chitinous. The respiration takes place by means of branched tracheal gills
which protrude from the dorsal surface of the last body segment; they are retractile.
The colour varies from deep green to yellow or almost black. Their food consists of
algÃ¦ and other organisms in the water brought to their mouth by two fan-like organs
placed on the head. The larvÃ¦ can crawl from place to place by means of the
thoracic proleg; they occur in masses, usually in a more or less erect attitude. A network
of threads is spun on their support, by means of which King tells us âthey are
enabled to maintain their position against the strongest current; frequently they will
leave their support and let themselves out into the stream anchored by threads of
silk and enabled by them to return.â</p>

<p>When full fed the larva spins a pocket-shaped cocoon on the support, within
which it pupates. The pupa is motionless and has a pair of branched spiracles projecting
from behind the head. When the adult emerges, a bubble of air collects
around it, and in this it floats to the surface and at once takes wing. The European
species take a month to complete larval life, a week being spent in the pupal stage.
The flies are most restless, and even when stationary continually move their legs
about like feelers. Sometimes the swarms consist entirely of females, sometimes
early in the season mostly of males.</p>

<p>The females pierce the skin of humans on tender spots, such as ears, the forehead,
around the eyes and nose, and crawl into the cavities. They are quite harmless
at night, mainly attacking about sunrise and sunset. Some crawl up the arms and
legs and down the neck, and leave behind little red weals which itch intensely
(<i>S. damnosum</i>, Theob.), and blood may flow freely from the wounds.</p>

<p>The following are some of the worst <span class="nowrap">species:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Simulium columbaschensis</i>, the âKolumbatz fly,â which abounds in the damp
marshy lands along the Danube, and is a great plague to man and beasts in Hungary,
and is also abundant in Austria and Moravia, and is most numerous after inundations
from the Danube. They sometimes appear in such swarms that it is impossible
to breathe without getting them into oneâs mouth. There are instances of children
being killed by these flies when left on the ground by their mothers when working
in the fields.</p>

<p><i>S. damnosum</i>, Theob. This occurs throughout Equatorial Africa and is known
as the âjinja flyâ in Uganda, the âfouronâ in the French Congo, the âkiltebâ
in the Sudan. It is a most vicious biter, and in some parts occurs in âbeltsâ;
Dr. Christy found one such extending from the shores of the Victoria Nyanza
northwards along the right bank of the Nile for twelve or fifteen miles or more, and
perhaps three or four miles wide. In this area the flies swarm in millions at certain<span class="pagenum" title="579"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579"></a></span>
seasons, so much so that the natives have to leave their plantations. The bite
causes a weal, marked by a drop of blood.</p>

<p><i>S. griseicollis</i>, Becker. The so-called ânimittiâ occurs in Upper Egypt and
the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. It lives near the river and is not found more than
half a mile from it. Human beings are bitten on the face and hands, animals in
the region of the pudenda.</p>

<p><i>S. latipes</i>, Meigen. This is a European species, also found in Natal.</p>

<p><i>S. wellmanni</i>, Roubaud. The âohomonoâ of Angola, where it bites viciously
and is dreaded by the naked porters.</p>

<p><i>S. buissoni</i>, Roubaud. Occurs in abundance in the Marquesas Islands. It has
been <i>suggested</i> that this species may help to propagate leprosy.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></p>

<p>A large number of these insects have been described by Lutz in Brazil.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></p>

<p>A <i>Simulium</i> sp. (?) is very harmful to poultry in Cape Colony.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></p>

<p>In America, <i>SimulidÃ¦</i> are most annoying. One, <i>S. meridionale</i>, Riley, also
known as the turkey gnat in the Mississippi Valley, has been supposed to be the
carrier of chicken cholera; anyhow, it has caused the death of thousands of chickens
and turkeys in Virginia annually.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></p>

<p>In Mexico Townsend found a Simulium which was named <i>S. occidentalis</i>, which
caused great annoyance to man, many people being so susceptible to them as to
preserve through the gnat season a chronic inflammation of the exposed parts of
face and neck, resulting from the repeated bites giving rise to sores.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></p>

<p>Men and horses have been partially incapacitated by the bites of sand-flies or
Simulium in a Hampshire wood (Cantlie, <i>Brit. Med. Journ.</i>, April 28, 1900,
v, No. 2,052, p.&nbsp;1023).</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <i>ChironomidÃ¦</i> or midges are not only frequently mistaken for mosquitoes,
but some are very annoying to man by biting him as mosquitoes do. They are
easily distinguished from true mosquitoes (<i>CulicidÃ¦</i>) by the following characters:
(1) head small, often retracted under the cowl-like thorax; (2) no scales to the wings
or body; and (3) the different arrangement of veins on the wings (fig.&nbsp;402).</p>

<p>Two genera are important as annoying man, namely, Culicoides, Latreille, and
Johannseniella, Williston. The larvÃ¦ of <i>ChironomidÃ¦</i> are either aquatic, both
fresh water and marine, and help to make the former foul,<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> according to Slater, or
may, as in <i>CeratopogoninÃ¦</i>, live beneath the bark of trees, etc. The pupÃ¦ are very

<p class="spec">Sub-family. <b>CeratopogoninÃ¦.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This sub-family of midges consists of very small species varying from 1 to
2&nbsp;mm. in length; the wings have darkened areas, and the second longitudinal vein
is wanting, and the first and third veins are stouter than the others and placed close
to the anterior margin, the fourth and fifth are forked; the antennÃ¦ in both male
and female are composed of fourteen segments, six or eight in the males bearing
long hairs.</p>

<p>The chief blood-sucking species belong to the genera Culicoides, Latreille,
and Johannseniella, Williston. The latter genus differs from the former in the
absence of an empodium or median appendage on the last segment of the tarsi.
The genus Ceratopogon, as restricted by Kieffer, is not supposed to take vertebrate
blood, but Austen has recently noticed that the type specimen of <i>C. castaneus</i>,
Walker, and a new species described by him, apparently have their bodies distended
with blood. The wings in the <i>CeratopogoninÃ¦</i> are carried flat when at rest.</p></div>

<p>In spite of their small size the females are the most bloodthirsty and annoying of
all insects. The Culicoides, which are often called âsand-flies,â bite during the day
and rarely at night. Usually they are most troublesome between 3 and 6&nbsp;p.m.
They frequently attack in swarms, especially in the open, and owing to their minute
size can get through fine mosquito netting. Some of them produce a distinct âbuzzâ
when on the wing. These insects are found in all parts of the world. No species
has been definitely connected with any disease, but Culicoides has been suspected of
carrying the germs of Delhi boil. The larvÃ¦ of Culicoides are elongate in form and
have smooth bodies composed of thirteen segments including the head, which is
horny; there is no proleg on the first segment as seen in Chironomus, and on the

<p>This family of diptera is of considerable importance, not only on account of the

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>PsychodidÃ¦</i> are all very small flies, many of which have a moth-like appearance,
and owing to their fluffy nature are spoken of in Britain as âowl flies,â sometimes
also as âwindow flies.â Their bodies and wings are covered with hairs, densely in
some (sub-family <i>PsychodinÃ¦</i>), and in a few with patches of flat squamÃ¦. In the non-blood-sucking
<i>PsychodinÃ¦</i> the wings are carried in a peculiar manner downwards
over the body, to a <i>slight extent</i> resembling the <i>HepialidÃ¦</i>, or swift moths. The
wings may be ovoid or lanceolate, and have a marked venation as seen in the figure.
The proboscis is short and non-suctorial in the majority of genera, but in the sub-family
<i>PhlebotominÃ¦</i> it is elongated and hard. The antennÃ¦ are long and of sixteen
segments, and bear whorls of fine hair.</p>

<p>There are two sub-families, <i>PsychodinÃ¦</i> and <i>PhlebotominÃ¦</i>; in the former the
mouth is not suctorial; the female has a horny ovipositor and the second longitudinal
vein is branched at the root of the wing; in the second sub-family the proboscis
may be formed for sucking, the female has no horny ovipositor, and the second long
vein has its first fork near the middle of the wing.</p>

<p>The sub-family <i>PhlebotominÃ¦</i> contains the genus Phlebotomus, which occurs in
South Europe, South Asia, Africa, North and South tropical America. They are
all small grey, brown, or dull yellow-coloured flies, and carry their wings when at rest
upwards like a butterfly. The proboscis is moderately long and the legs long and thin.</p>

<p>The females are most vicious blood-suckers, but in some species anyhow the<span class="pagenum" title="582"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582"></a></span>
males also bite (<i>P. duboscii</i>). They are mainly nocturnal feeders and hide away
during the day in any dark corners or crevices.</p>

<p>The life-cycle has been worked out by Newstead<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> and Grassi<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> in Europe, and
by Howlett<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> in India.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ have been found in crevices in rocks and caves, in dirty cellars, and
dark damp places containing rubbish, and are also said to live in crevices in the
walls of privies and cesspits.</p>

<p>The minute larva is very marked; as figured by Newstead it has two long chÃ¦tÃ¦
projecting upwards, in some stages branched, in others simple, and on the segments
a few blunt spine-like processes. The pupÃ¦ are found in similar situations.
The ova are very minute, elongate, translucent white, and covered with a thin coating
of viscous matter when first laid; soon after they become dark brown, shiny, with
long black wavy lines. Newstead found the incubation period in Malta to last for
about nine days in <i>P. papatacii</i>. Five species are known in Europe, five in Africa,<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a>
two in North America, and eight are described by Annandale<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> in the Oriental region.
Lutz and Neiva have described three species from Brazil<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> (<i>P. longipalpis</i>, <i>intermedius</i>
and <i>squamiventris</i>).</p></div>


<p class="ph1"><b>Brachycera</b> (Flies).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The antennÃ¦ as a rule have three segments, and are usually shorter than the head.
The first segment of the antennÃ¦ is frequently very small, and the third one is generally
the largest, and sometimes possesses a terminal annulated bristle. The palpi have
from one to three segments; the mandibles are covered by the labium. The three
thoracic rings are coalesced; wings are almost always present, the posterior ones
being rudimentary and covered with a little scale. From the ova legless maggots
are hatched, which as a rule have not a distinct head, but occasionally possess
two claw-like hooklets. These maggots live in decomposing organic matter; they
rarely live in water and some of them are parasitic. They either become barrel-shaped
pupÃ¦ within the last larval integument or, after casting it, are transformed
into naked pupÃ¦. The larvÃ¦ of numerous <i>Brachycera</i> have been observed
in man, some in ulcers or on mucous membranes, others in the skin or in the
intestine, etc. In many cases the report only mentions the presence of the larvÃ¦ of
flies; in other cases the species has been determined; whilst in still other cases the
corresponding adult creature is unknown. We must therefore confine ourselves to
describing the most common varieties.</p></div>

<p>These flies belong to the same division of <i>Diptera</i>, the Aschiza, as the family
<i>SyrphidÃ¦</i> or âhover flies.â They are all small insects with marked antennÃ¦ and
wings; the former have the third segment globular and enlarged, and thus hiding
the first two; the wings are short and broad, the venation shows two short, thick,
long veins with four thin ones running out from them. The larvÃ¦ normally live in

<p>This small fly belonging to this family is of an orange-ochreous colour, the
upper part of the thorax tawny, and with dark bands on the abdomen, legs pale
yellow, the hind femora tipped with dark brown. It measures only 2 to 3&nbsp;mm. in
length. This insect is shown by Austen to be widely distributed in the tropics,
being found in India, Burma, West Africa, and Central America. The larvÃ¦ breed
in decaying animal matter, such as putrid meat, decomposing shell-fish, etc.</p>

<p>Heusner bred out sixty-three flies from larvÃ¦ taken from an Indianâs foot.</p>

<p>Baker (<i>Proc. Burma Branch Brit. Med. Assoc.</i>, 1891, p.&nbsp;11â16) found that
the maggots of this fly were passed <i>per anum</i> by a European at intervals during
a period of ten months. Baker found that the larvÃ¦ fed on human fÃ¦ces; from
the egg stage to the deposition of eggs from the resultant brood of flies occupied
twenty-two days. He concludes that they are capable of propagating, and do
so while living within the human intestines. He also records the larvÃ¦ in two
girls.</p>

canal of human beings alive, and have been occasionally referred to in cases of
internal myiasis. It also breeds in dead bodies in adipose tissue. Howard records
it on human excrement. It is thus possible that some of the recorded cases of this

been obtained in foul drinking water by human beings and from eating watercress
improperly washed or from badly kept beds. Austen (<i>Trans. Soc. Trop. Med. and

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is not only on account of a few larvÃ¦ of the common house-fly (<i>Musca
domestica</i>) being found in the intestines of man that it is of importance medically.
It is far more important on account of the part it plays in the spread of diseases
of the intestines, such as typhoid fever and cholera, infantile diarrhÅa and
dysentery.</p>

<p>Howard and Clark (<i>Journ. Exp. Med.</i>, 1912, xvi, No. 6, pp.&nbsp;850â859) have shown
that the house-fly is capable of carrying the virus of poliomyelitis for several days
on the surface of the body and for several hours in the gastro-intestinal tract.
The house-fly may also distribute the ova of <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i> and the white worms
(Oxyuris and Ascaris). It has also been proved that they may carry the germs
of tuberculosis, and it is said that they play an important part in the spread
of infectious ophthalmia in Egypt.</p>

<p>This insect is found in all parts of the world. In warm countries it breeds
all the year round, and it may do so even in temperate climates in warm places,
such as stove houses. Most, however, die off in the autumn; but some survive the
winter as adults, in such places as kitchens, restaurants, and warm houses. I have
never failed to find a few <i>Musca domestica</i> in houses during the winter. The
majority, however, hibernate as puparia.</p>

<p>The females deposit from 120 to 150 eggs in a batch in stable manure, rotting
vegetation, house refuse, spent hops, old soiled bedding, etc. A single female
may lay as many as six batches of ova during her life. The eggs are shiny white,
and hatch in from eight to twenty-four hours in warm weather to three or four
days in cool weather. The white footless maggots are cylindrical, tapering to
a point at the head end, truncated posteriorly. The head consists of two dark
mandibular hooks and two short antennÃ¦. On the tail end are two plates, the
stigmata, in which the main tracheal trunks open; in the second segment are
a small pair of projecting stigmata. The larval stage lasts from seven to five
days in hot weather; but in cold weather in temperate climes it may last six or
eight weeks.</p>

<p>The larva on reaching maturity becomes a barrel-shaped puparium of a dark
brown to black colour, and in this case changes to the pupa. This stage lasts from
three days in the tropics to four or five weeks in cold weather, the life cycle thus
varying from ten days in the tropics to fourteen in warm weather in Europe up to
three or four months under unfavourable conditions.</p>

<p>All breeding grounds should be burnt or otherwise done away with, such
as stable manure, house and kitchen refuse, human excrement and soiled substances,
also decaying vegetation as soon as possible, certainly by every sixth day. Stable
manure should be kept in closed receptacles and should be removed by every sixth
day to at least one mile from habitations and sprinkled with chloride of lime.
All kitchen and household refuse should be burnt at once or buried in pits and
covered with soil. Latrines should be as far as possible from hospitals, mess rooms
and tents. Food&mdash;especially milk, sugar and fruit&mdash;should be kept screened with
muslin when house-flies are about. Mess rooms and tents and hospitals should
have doors and windows screened with fine wire gauze during the fly season.
All possible steps should be taken to prevent them contaminating manâs food and
from breeding in human excrement and from entering hospitals. When present
in dwelling-houses in numbers they may be killed by fumigation with pyrethrum
or sulphur.</p></div>

<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Pycnosoma</b>, Brauer and v. Bergenstamm.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The species of this genus have a general resemblance to the Lucilias and
Chrysomyias, but the body is stouter and the abdomen banded. The genus can be
distinguished from Chrysomyia by the absence of the three thoracic stripes and
by the eyes of the male, in which the facets forming the upper portion are much
enlarged, whereas in Chrysomyia they are not noticeably larger. Austen also points
out that the sterno-pleural bristles in Pycnosoma are 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1, in Chrysomyia 2&nbsp;:&nbsp;1.
The genus is found in tropical Asia and Africa only. All records of Chrysomyia
(Compsomyia) in India must be referred to this genus. Bezzi and Stein (âKatalog
der PalÄarktischen Dipteren,â 1907, iii, p.&nbsp;543), however, regard the two as
synonymous.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ are frequently found in the nostrils of man and burrow into the sinus,
but normally they live on decaying animal matter.</p>

<p>Pycnosoma forms the so-called Indian screw-worm. Patterson (<i>Ind. Med. Gaz.</i>,
October, 1909, xliv, No. 10) records the case of a woman at Tezpin, Assam, from
whom as many as 100 larvÃ¦ were removed at one time, and later the left orbital
cavity was found packed with hundreds of maggots; eventually the patient died.
It is possible that this, however, was due to a species of Sarcophaga. Austen
undoubtedly records this genus causing nasal myiasis in India (<i>Trans. Soc. Trop.
Med. and Hyg.</i>, iii, p.&nbsp;235). At Dehra Doon, U.P., a woman discharged 100
larvÃ¦ from her nose, with great pain in the nasal region and frontal sinuses.</p>

<p>The so-called âpeenash,â a common malady in Rajputana, is a true nasal myiasis.</p></div>

<p>Indigenous to the Senegal and neighbouring districts;
in the district of Cayor (between the mouth of the Senegal

It lives under the skin, especially at the lower extremities

discontinues. Besides man the larva occurs in dogs, goats,

<p>Distributed in the region of Natal and apparently over the whole of South
Africa. The âlarva of Natal,â as one may still term the species provisionally, as
its identity is not certain, possesses on its head (besides the mouth hooks) lateral
protuberances beset with a row of chitinous spines. The cuticle of the body is
spinose. The spines are difficult to recognize on account of their transparency and
want of colour; they are longest over the anterior segments, from the fifth they
become smaller, and over the
hindermost they are very small.
Apart from the foremost segment,
the position they take is that
of rows running transversely or
obliquely, two to four generally
in juxtaposition; the number of
spines in the groups gradually
increases posteriorly, attaining the
number of eight to twelve on the
sixth segment, and this number is
maintained to the end of the body.
Isolated spines are found over the
head; over the second, third and
fourth segments single ones are
still found adjoining the groups of
spines, from the fifth onward they
are wanting. From here the spines
cover the whole free surface of the segments; over the fourth the anterior three-quarters,
over the third two-thirds and over the first and second only the anterior
half. The stigmata found at the anterior end also serve as distinguishing characters.
The parasitic stage appears to last about fourteen days. [Fuller (<i>Agric. Journ.</i>,

<p>This well-known cutaneous African parasite seems to have been the cause
of much confusion in regard to names. It belongs to the genus Cordylobia
of GrÃ¼nberg, and is one of the family <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>, and differs from Auchmeromyia
in that the second abdominal segment of the female is of normal size, whilst
in Auchmeromyia it is more than half the length of the whole abdomen, and in the
male the eyes are holoptic or close together, whilst in Auchmeromyia they are wide
apart. The flies of this genus (three so far described) attack man in their larval
stage (anyway two of the three), and also dogs and other animals, by burrowing into
the skin and producing painful boils.</p>

<p>[<i>C. anthropophaga</i>, GrÃ¼nberg, is widely distributed in Africa, extending from
Senegal, where its maggot is known as the âver de Cayor,â and is referred
to on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_590">590</a> as <i>Ochromyia anthropophaga</i>, E. Blanchard, to Natal, where it is
known as the âNatal worm,â and referred to erroneously on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_591">591</a> as <i>Bengalia
depressa</i>, Walker.</p>

<p>[It is a thick-set Muscid of a general straw-yellow colour, with blackish markings
on the dorsum of both thorax and abdomen, about 9Â·5&nbsp;mm. long. The larva is fat
and when mature about 12&nbsp;mm. long, bluntly pointed in front, truncate behind;
from the third to eleventh segments it is thickly covered with minute recurved
spines of a brownish colour, arranged in transverse series of groups of two or more,
which form more or less distinct irregular transverse rows. On each of the two
posterior stigmatic plates, the respiratory slit on either side of the median one
is characteristically curved, resembling an inverted note of interrogation. The
puparium is brown to ferruginous or black and about 10&nbsp;mm. long. The maggots
are found in both natives and white men, and occur as a severe pest in dogs, also
in monkeys, rats, and other mammals. In Sierra Leone it is called the âtumba
fly.â The larvÃ¦ have been frequently found as true subcutaneous parasites, each
larva living singly and forming a boil or warble in the skin, with an opening just as in
an ox-warble, through which the maggot breathes and eventually escapes. Although
they more usually occur as isolated specimens, Marshall found in Salisbury,
South Rhodesia, that sixty were extracted from one lady, and BÃ©renger-FÃ©raud, in
Senegal, that more than 300 occurred in a single spaniel puppy.</p>

<p>[Neave (<i>Bull. Ent. Res.</i>, 1912, iii, p.&nbsp;217) records it from ulcers in a native
at LourenÃ§o Marques in 1908, and at the same time from ulcers in a dog, and that
it is a severe pest to man in Mozambique and parts of the Transvaal. It seems
to be more abundant in North Rhodesia and Nyasaland than to the north (Neave,
<i>Bull. Ent. Res.</i>, 1912, iii, p.&nbsp;310). It is also recorded in Zanzibar, German East
Africa, Uganda, East Tropical Africa (Neave).</p>

<p class="spec">Family. <b>OestridÃ¦.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The family of <i>OestridÃ¦</i> or warble flies are all parasitic in their larval stage,
usually termed the âbotâ stage. They are found as parasites in warm-blooded
animals, and man is frequently attacked by them. The members of this family have
the mouth rudimentary, many of them are hairy and bee-like, with large eyes and the
head large, the lower part more or less swollen. The thorax is large with a distinct
transverse suture, and the abdomen short and stumpy or very slightly elongated.
The male genitalia are hidden, whilst the female ovipositor is often elongated. The
wings may be transparent (Hypoderma) or mottled (Gastrophilus), and have muscid-like
venation; the tegulÃ¦ usually large, the legs moderately long.</p>

<p>[As a rule each species is confined to a particular host, but as we see recorded
here those that attack animals may also attack man. The flies occur in warm weather
and usually during the warmest part of the day, and have a strong dislike to shade
and water. The genus Hypoderma attack oxen, sheep, goats, antelope and musk
deer; Oestrus, sheep, antelope and horses; Gastrophilus, the horse and ass;
Cephenomyia, the deer; Cepholomyia, the camel and buffalo; Dermatobia, dogs,
cats, oxen, deer, apes and man; Cuterebra and Rogenhofera, rodents and opossums.</p>

<p>[Some live as parasites in the stomach and intestines (Gastrophilus); others
infest the skin (Hypoderma, Dermatobia and Oestromyia, the latter on <i>Lagomys</i> and
<i>HypodÃ¦us</i>); <i>Ådemagena tarandi</i> also infests the skin of the reindeer in Siberia and
boreal America. Oestrus lives in the nasal sinus, and Cephalomyia in the throat as
well, Cuterebra and Rogenhofera, the skin or scrotum, so that we have really three
groups of parasitic oestride larvÃ¦: (i) cutaneous, (ii) intestinal, and (iii) facial.</p>

<p>[No species seems confined to man, but the so-called âcreeping disease,â caused
by HypodermÃ¦, and the attack of sheep nasal fly are comparatively common, as also
is the Dermatobia attack.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.].</p></div>

head or on the hair of grazing cattle: through the young being licked off they gain
access to the mouth and are swallowed.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> The larvÃ¦ appear first in the commencing
portion of the stomach, to escape, as some state, into the preceding sections of the
alimentary canal; at any rate, they are found from July onward regularly in the
submucous tissue of the pharynx, in which they travel about for several months
(up to November, and in isolated cases up to February); they then penetrate the
muscularis and migrate by way of the subserosa along the mediastinum, the crura
of the diaphragm, the renal capsules, and the intermuscular connective tissue of the
psoas muscle in the direction of the spinal canal, into which they penetrate by way
of the muscles and nerves, through the intervertebral foramina. Here they stay for
about two to three months, then they leave the spinal canal again through the
vertebral foramina and make their way (from January to March) through the intermuscular
connective tissue of the muscles of the back to the skin of the back, where
sooner or later (from January to June) they arrive and enter a resting stage, which
commences with penetration of the skin and terminates with outward migration
from the boils due to the wound set up by the maggot. At the commencement
of this period the larvÃ¦ cast their skin, and their form, hitherto cylindrical, becomes
oval. After about a month, a second moulting of the skin takes place&mdash;the third
larval stage, which lasts about two and a half months (up to June). The approaching
end of the same is indicated by a change of colour on the part of the larva from the
hitherto yellowish-white to brown and finally to blackish-brown. When they have
become mature the larvÃ¦ leave the warbles, drop on to the ground and pass into
the pupal stage in the superficial layers of the soil within twelve to thirty-six hours.
After about a month the flies emerge. Irregularities with regard to the time and
direction of the migrations of the larvÃ¦ take place (Jost, H., in <i>Zeitschr. f. wiss.
Zool.</i>, 1907, xxxvi, p.&nbsp;644).</p></div>


<p>In a number of cases the larva of the cattle fly has been observed
in the human integument, usually in the winter months, that is,
during the migration period; consequently, it is not surprising that
the larvÃ¦ before they enter on the resting stage and produce a warble
undergo migrations. But that this takes place subcutaneously&mdash;which
does not appear to be so in the case of cattle&mdash;is perhaps
explained by the fact that in man, on account of the short space that
has to be traversed, the larvÃ¦ are not sufficiently developed to enter
on the resting stage simultaneously upon having obtained access
to the integument. Whether the Oestrid larvÃ¦ in Bulgaria that
similarly migrate beneath the skin in man belong to the cattle fly
or to another species, or even another genus, has not yet been<span class="pagenum" title="596"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596"></a></span>

<p>The larvÃ¦ of this species, that occurs not only in Europe but in North America,
live under similar conditions in the skin, very rarely in man; also migrating
subcutaneously (Topsent in <i>Arch. de Par.</i>, 1901, iv, p.&nbsp;609).</p>

<p>[In Sweden, the ox warble fly (<i>H. bovis</i>) is well known to attack man.
Schoyen states âthat over 100 years ago up to the present time cases of travelling
grubs under the human skin in some districts of Sweden were well known.â
The species appeared to be <i>H. bovis</i>, many of which he had examined. They
accomplished long ramblings under the skin, always in an upward direction,
previous to their appearance through an opening in a tumour on the upper part of
the body, on the head, neck, or shoulders. An interesting case is recorded in
<i>Insect Life</i>, ii, pp.&nbsp;238â239. A bot similar to <i>H. diana</i> was taken from the eye
and cheek of a child at Kane, McKean County, Pa., U.S.A. It was said
to have travelled in five months from the elbow to the eye. Riley later (<i>Insect
Life</i>, iv, p.&nbsp;310) was inclined to think the maggot was that of <i>H. lineata</i>,
the common American ox warble, which is also found in Europe in great
numbers. I have recorded another case in England (<i>Rept. Econ. Zool.</i> for
year ending September 30, 1910, p.&nbsp;128), where Dr. Menzies removed the larva
of <i>H. bovis</i> from the upper eyelid of a patient. It caused considerable swelling
of the face, much pain and distress; but the case did well, and the wound healed
at once. The larva was nearly mature. Numerous other references to this
so-called creeping disease will be found in the Supplement.</p>

<p>[It is quite probable that <i>bovis</i> and <i>lineata</i> are confused in the latter accounts.
The larvÃ¦ are, however, easily distinguished if carefully examined.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p></div>

It is assumed that in all cases one and the same species is concerned, for which
recently a name originating from C. LinnÃ©, jun. (<i>Oestrus hominis</i>), has been
employed. Three larval stages are recognized in the skin; the two first appear to<span class="pagenum" title="597"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597"></a></span>
resemble one another in the club-shaped or tadpole-like appearance (called macaque
in Cayenne, mayacuil [mayoquil] in Mexico), the third is swollen spindle-shaped
(Berne, called torcel). Segments 2 to 4 in the club-shaped larvÃ¦ are closely beset
with small black spines, segments 5 to 7 bear at the anterior border a complete ring
of strong black hooks, segments 4 to 6 a similar ring, which, however, is interrupted at
the ventral surface. The four last segments forming the tail are smooth, only at the
posterior end are there small spines. The arrangement of spines of the third stage
differs from this. Italian workmen that have been employed in Brazil show the
presence of Dermatobia larvÃ¦ on their return (Blanchard, in <i>Bull. Soc. Ent.

<p>[<i>Dermatobia cyaniventris</i>, Macquart, 1843, is said not to be the same as <i>noxialis</i>
(<i>vide</i> Brauer, âMono. Oestriden,â 1863, p.&nbsp;266). It is known by various other names,<span class="pagenum" title="598"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598"></a></span>
as nuche or gusano in New Granada, the ura in Brazil, and the macaw fly in
Cayenne. It occurs in Central and South America and the West Indies. According
to Goudot the fly is found in great numbers on the borders of large woods and
lands covered with underwood.</p>

<p>[It is seldom that more than one larva is found in each individual. It is generally
found in the arm and leg, but now and then the face. The perfect insect has never
been bred from a larva removed from a human being, so that there is still uncertainty
as to the actual species. <i>D. cyaniventris</i> is 11 to 12&nbsp;mm. long, has an ochraceous
buff-coloured face, dark grey thorax, metallic dark blue to purple abdomen, and
brownish wings. <i>D. noxialis</i> is somewhat larger.</p>

<p>[In the <i>Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</i>, January 15, 1905, viii, p.&nbsp;23,
reference is made to this Oestrid in Trinidad, where it is called the âmosquito
worm.â One case here recorded showed no fewer than four worms on the chin and
one on the hand. It is here stated that the fly never attacks man or animals directly,
as it is said to do by Scheube, but that the eggs are deposited on leaves and branches
in wooded lands and forests, and thus man, hunting dogs and wild animals in
passing through get the larvÃ¦ deposited on them accidentally. The affection is
common in Trinidad. Mention is made that a little 1 in 40 carbolic lotion syringed
into the aperture in the skin over the worm quickly killed it.</p>

<p>[The cattle worm, or founzaia ngÃ³mbe, is the name given to a larva which
develops beneath the skin of oxen and men in Central Africa, especially amongst the
natives and stock of Unyamonezi. According to P. Dutrieux, the egg is laid by a
large fly that accompanies cattle. It is unknown between the central plateau or the
Ugogo and the East Coast.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p></div>

humans in Algeria whilst flying, but that they disappear after three to ten days or
the inflammation produced by them. Portschinsky (<i>Mem. Bur. Ent. Sci. Com. Cent.
Bd. Land Adm. and Agric.</i>, 1913, x, No. 3, p.&nbsp;63) also gives cases. He doubts
that ova are laid on the nose; evidently the Russian habit is anomalous, for the
Sergents, Collings and myself find ova laid as a common occurrence. I have often
seen them on the nose of sheep. This fly also occurs in the Argentine (Serres, in
<i>Gaceta Rural</i>, April, 1913, vi, pp.&nbsp;759â761).</p>

<p>[The tamnÃ© or thimni of the Kabyles, a human myiasis of the Tuareg mountains
in the Sahara, is caused by <i>Oestrus ovis</i>. Here the larvÃ¦ are said to be ejected on

<p>[Ed. and Lt. Sergent (<i>Bull. Soc. Path. exot.</i>, 1913, vi, No. 7, pp.&nbsp;487â488) report

It burrows into the epidermis of man by minute passages. This observation
should, however, be verified. The phenomenon is designated as skin-mole, larva

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Amongst the division <i>Brachycera</i> (as meant in this work) we get several groups
of flies which, like the fleas and mosquitoes, are partially parasitic on man, the adults,
mainly in the female sex, being provided with a piercing mouth with which they
extract the blood of man and animals. The importance of these parasites is not the
mere fact that they feed upon our blood, but that they often carry germs from man
to man (tsetse-flies and trypanosomiasis, <i>TabanidÃ¦</i> and anthrax). Amongst the
most important biting-mouthed <i>Diptera</i> in this section are the following: <i>TabanidÃ¦</i>,
or gad-flies; <i>GlossinÃ¦</i>, or tsetse-flies; and certain other <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>. Some of the
exotic <i>AsilidÃ¦</i> and a few <i>LeptidÃ¦</i> also bite man.</p></div>


<p class="spec">Family. <b>TabanidÃ¦</b> (Gad-flies).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The <i>TabanidÃ¦</i> have a broad, rather flattened body and a large head; eyes united
in the male (except in some Chrysops). The antennÃ¦ are composed of three segments,
have the third joint composed of five to eight annuli&mdash;in Chrysops they are
fairly long. The proboscis is projecting, and sometimes much elongated. The legs
are moderately stout. The venation of the wings is shown in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_415">415</a>.</p>

<p>[This family of gad or horse flies contains a great number of genera, all of
which may bite animals and man more or less severely. The female alone is
blood-sucking, the males feed upon the juices of flowers. The females deposit their
spindle-shaped white, black, or brown eggs on leaves, stems of plants that either
overhang or stand in water, and amongst rushes; they are at first white, but become
brown or black. The eggs are laid in rounded, flattened or conical masses composed
of layers one upon the other. The larvÃ¦ are carnivorous, feeding upon snails,
worms, other larvÃ¦, etc., and have a distinct head; they are cylindrical, composed
of eleven segments, the last with a vertical breathing pore, or the last two
segments may form a breathing tube. The majority taper to a point at each end, in
colour shining white or dull grey to yellowish, many of the larger specimens mottled
or banded with dark brown or black. The first seven abdominal segments are
encircled near the anterior margin with a ring of fleshy protuberances consisting of
a transverse dorsal ridge which may be divided by a depression into two. The
young larvÃ¦ burrow into any soft vegetable substance; they live both in the water
and under damp soil surrounding water, also in damp earth generally. The larvÃ¦
are not only carnivorous, but they are cannibals, frequently devouring their own
species. They may take more than a year to mature.</p>

<p>[The pupÃ¦ are found close to the surface of mud and earth, and are mostly dull
yellowish to brown in colour, with rows of spines on the distal third of each
abdominal segment; the thorax bears a pair of ear-shaped spiracular structures, and
there are also six denticles at the apex of the abdomen.</p>

<p>[A habit common to the adults of most of the <i>TabanidÃ¦</i> of considerable economic<span class="pagenum" title="601"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601"></a></span>
importance is that of the adults coming to water to drink. Portschinsky<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> has found
that by applying kerosene to the pool they frequent the adults are killed, and
Hine<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> that the same oil kills the larvÃ¦ that fall into the water from eggs laid on
plants above.</p>

<p>[<i>TabanidÃ¦</i> are not only of importance as purely biting insects, for they may
often convey pathogenic organisms from one animal to another, such as the
bacillus of anthrax, which they are known to carry, and possibly also trypanosomes
in regard to man. Chrysops also acts as a host of <i>Filaria loa</i> in South
Nigeria (Leiper, <i>Brit. Med. Journ.</i>, January, 1912, pp.&nbsp;39â40). Two species are
incriminated, <i>viz.</i>, <i>C. silacea</i> and <i>C. dimidiata</i>. With animals these flies play
a more important part, for MM. Sergent, in Algeria, have proved that species of
Tabanus are able to transmit three forms of animal trypanosomes by biting a
healthy animal as long as twenty-two hours after having bitten an unhealthy
one. In India they have also been shown to transmit the parasite of âsurraâ
in dogs and rabbits by Rogers. Other observers have since corroborated these
results, and Mitzmain, who has recently performed valuable work in this connection,
states that <i>T. striatus</i> is undoubtedly the carrier of this disease in the Philippine
Islands. Certain members of the genus HÃ¦matopota have also been shown to be
capable of the direct transmission of <i>Trypanosoma evansi.</i> Martoglio (<i>Ann.
dâIg. sper.</i>, 1913, xxiii, N.S., No. 3, pp.&nbsp;363â366) states that the trypanosome disease
of dromedaries known as salaf is transmitted by <i>TabanidÃ¦</i>, especially Pangonia
(<i>P. magretti</i> and <i>P. beckeri</i>) in Italian Somaliland. It is quite likely that these
flies play a much greater part in the spread of such diseases than is imagined
at the present time.</p></div>

the latter have neither tibial spurs nor ocelli.</p>

<p>[The <i>PangoninÃ¦</i> contain two main genera, Pangonia and Chrysops. In the
former the proboscis is much elongated, and the third antennal segment is composed
of eight rings, and is never angulated or ungulated at the base. The proboscis
is often very long.</p>

<p>[In Chrysops, the so-called blinding storm flies, all the three segments of the
antennÃ¦ are long, the third having only five annulations, and the proboscis short
but very strong.</p>

<p>[There are many genera in the <i>TabaninÃ¦</i>, which are found in all parts of the
world, of which two only are shown here&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, Tabanus and HÃ¦matopota. The
former has the first two segments of the antennÃ¦ short, the third angulated
at the base, sometimes spurred and composed of five annulations; the second
has the second segment short, and the third composed of four annulations&mdash;never
angulated nor spurred at the base&mdash;and the wings are adorned with grey or

<p>[These flies are of little importance in regard to the subject dealt with in this
book; but I have notes sent concerning the biting habits of one or more species
belonging to this family from the Malay States and Africa.</p>

<p>[<i>AsilidÃ¦</i>, or wolf flies, are easily told by the following characters: Large or
moderate-sized flies, thickly hairy; head separated from thorax by a narrow neck;
eyes separated in both sexes; proboscis firm and horny, adapted for piercing;
abdomen long, pointed, and composed of eight segments. Legs strong and bristly,
of moderate length. Wings sometimes mottled, lying parallel over the abdomen
when at rest. There are nearly 3,000 species. They live mostly upon insects, but
some are said to bite animals and man. They are, however, of little importance in
this respect.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="603"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603"></a></span></p>


<p class="spec">Family. <b>LeptidÃ¦.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This widely distributed family of flies has a few species which suck the blood of
man, and the writer has been personally badly bitten in Norway by a Leptis which
was apparently <i>Leptis scolopacea</i>.</p>

<p>[The <i>LeptidÃ¦</i> have usually blotched wings and similar venation to Tabanus; they
are elongated flies of moderate or large size, and of dull colours. The antennÃ¦ are
varied and consist of three segments, either with or without a terminal bristle or with
the third segment compound, and in a few they may be almost nematocerous. The
wing veins are distinct, very crowded anteriorly, the third long vein is furcate, basal
cells large, and there are usually five posterior cells, the anal cell being open in some;
the squamÃ¦ are always small, sometimes only rudimentary.</p>

<p>[Four are known to be blood-suckers, namely the American Symphoromyia,
<i>Trichopalpus obscurus</i> in Chili, and <i>Leptis strigosa</i> and <i>L. scolopacea</i> in Europe.
The genus Symphoromyia has a single spur on the hind tibiÃ¦, none on the fore or
mid tibiÃ¦, the third segment of the three-ringed antennÃ¦ kidney-shaped, and a short
proboscis. In the genus Leptis the hind tibiÃ¦ have two spurs, and the third antennal
segment is not reniform.</p>

<p>[The other biting genus Trichopalpus can be told at once by the elongated
proboscis. Most of this family live upon other insects. The larvÃ¦ live in earth,
decaying wood, sand, stagnant waters, and the nests of wood-boring beetles; they
are usually cylindrical and may have fleshy abdominal legs; the anal segment has
a transverse cleft, and often two posteriorly directed processes and two stigmata
between them. They are all predaceous, and in one genus (Vermileo) make pitfalls
in sand like the ant lions (<i>Myrmeleon</i>).</p></div>


<p class="ph2">Blood-sucking MuscidÃ¦.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The blood-sucking <i>MuscidÃ¦</i> are mainly contained in the following genera:
Glossina, Stomoxys, HÃ¦matobia, Lyperosia, Stygeromyia, PhilÃ¦matomyia and
Bdellolarynx.</p>

<p>[The first is the most important genus on account of the part it plays in the
spread of trypanosome diseases. Stomoxys may also serve as a disease carrier.
The remainder and a few more genera cause considerable annoyance by their
bites, and may also act as occasional carriers of pathogenic organisms. All these
flies have their mouth parts elongated to some extent, forming a distinct proboscis,
which becomes more or less strongly chitinized; the labella are usually serrated
or spiny, and thus form a structure easily capable of piercing the skin. Unlike
the <i>CulicidÃ¦</i>, the blood-sucking <i>MuscidÃ¦</i> have the sanguinary habit common to both
sexes.</p></div>

Wied. (After GrÃ¼nberg.)</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This genus contains sixteen species,<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> all of which are confined to the Ethiopian
region. Glossina may be distinguished from other allied genera by the proboscis,
the antennÃ¦, wings, and male genitalia. The proboscis projects forwards and has
a swollen bulb-like base to the slender labium which holds the two structures, the
needle-like epipharynx and the thread-like hypopharynx; the whole proboscis is<span class="pagenum" title="604"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604"></a></span>
ensheathed in the maxillary palpi. The antennÃ¦ have the first two segments small,
the third large with a marked pore, the orifice of the sense organ near the base;
from the base of the third segment also arises the three-jointed arista, the first two
segments being, however, minute; the
third bears a series of from seventeen
to twenty-one fine branched hairs on one
side. The male genitalia or hypopygium
is more or less oval and tumid, its long
axis lying in the antero-posterior direction,
with a vulviform median groove (the
anus) running from the anterior margin
to beyond the middle.</p>

<p>[Newstead has shown the importance
of the study of the genitalia in separating
species (<i>vide</i> <i>Bull. Ent. Res.</i>, ii, pp.&nbsp;9â36
and 107â110, and iii, pp.&nbsp;355â360; and
<i>Ann. Trop. Med. and Par.</i>, vii, No. 2,

</div>

<p>[The tsetse-flies reproduce differently from all other <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>. The female produces
at each birth a single full-grown larva, which is retained within the oviduct and
there nourished by the secretion of special glands, and on being born crawls to some
hiding place and at once becomes a puparium.</p>

<p>[The larva is a yellowish footless maggot nearly as large as the motherâs body,
the skin shagreened and the anal extremity having a pair of large, black, granular
prominences separated by a depression containing the breathing pores.</p>

<p>[The puparium is brown of various shades, the tumid lips of the larva being conspicuous,
the size and shape of the lips enabling the puparia to be identified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="605"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605"></a></span></p>

<p>[These puparia are often found in masses at the base of trees, in hollows in trees
and rocks just buried under vegetal debris. These insects are generally confined
to definite tracts known as âfly-belts.â They usually occur in damp, hot places on
the borders of rivers and lakes, and never far from water in the case of the <i>palpalis</i>
group, although others of the <i>morsitans</i> group may be found a considerable distance
from water. They are usually absent on grass plains, but may now and then occur
there (Kinghorn, <i>vide</i> Hindlesâ âFlies and Disease, Blood-sucking Flies,â 1914,
p. 274); cover of trees, shrubs, or thick reeds is essential to them.</p>

<p>[Their range in Africa extends roughly from 18Â° N. to 31Â° S.</p>

<p>[<i>Glossina palpalis</i> is the chief carrier of the more prevalent type of sleeping
sickness. Two distinct types of parasites can produce this disease, <i>viz.</i>, <i>Trypanosoma
gambiense</i>, which produces the ordinary sleeping sickness, transmitted by
<i>G. palpalis</i>, and <i>Trypanosoma rhodesiense</i> the Rhodesian or Nyasaland sleeping
sickness, transmitted by <i>G. morsitans</i>, and possibly identical with <i>T. brucei</i>, the
parasite of Nâagana. Koch has also shown that <i>G. pallidipes</i>, Austen, and <i>G. fusca</i>,
Walker, can be artificially infected with the human trypanosome. It appears
probable that Koch used <i>G. brevipalpis</i>, not <i>G. fusca</i>, in his transmission experiments,
as at that time fusca included nearly all the large tsetses, but <i>brevipalpis</i>
is its Eastern representative.</p>

</div>

<p>[This is the chief carrier of sleeping sickness in Nature. It is found in places
over the whole of West Africa from the mouth of the Senegal River to Angola,
and extends eastwards into the Bahr-el-Ghazal. The eastern boundary follows the
valley of the Nile and includes the eastern
shores of Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika;
from the southern end of the lake the
boundary tends south-west, approximately
following the frontier between North-eastern
Rhodesia and the Congo Free State, and
passing through the Katanga district of
the latter country into Angola (Austen).
It may occur up to 3,000&nbsp;ft.; but, according
to Bagshawe, it has not been recorded
above 4,000&nbsp;ft. It feeds on the blood of
many animals, including reptiles, amphibia,
birds, and even amphibious fishes, as well
as all the wild mammals. It seems, however,
to possess a decided predilection for
man, and undoubtedly thrives better upon
mammals and birds than upon cold-blooded
animals.</p>

<p>[It is not usually found far from water,
requiring a humid atmosphere and temperature
of about 85Â°&nbsp;F. (shade). But a
marked seasonal distribution is shown, the
flies considerably extending their range
during the rainy season, and thus visiting districts which are dry for the greater
part of the year; as the rains diminish the fly gradually leaves the temporary
haunts and returns to the more permanent ones. It bites only by day, and then
only in sunny weather, and usually lives in shade.</p>

<p>[Roubaud has shown that the first larva produced is about three weeks after
copulation, and that others are produced at an interval of nine or ten days. The
puparium stage is rapidly produced after the expulsion of the larva, often in<span class="pagenum" title="608"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608"></a></span>
three-quarters of an hour. The puparium stage lasts from thirty-two to thirty-five
days. The puparia occur in well-drained humus close to water, sheltered by trees
or bushes, in crevices in rocks, and between the exposed roots of trees, sometimes
in sand.</p>

<p>[Bruce has shown that only a very small percentage of flies fed experimentally
on infected animals ultimately become infective, and that the infectivity of this
small percentage depends upon a delayed infection of the salivary glands.</p>

<p>[A variety, <i>wellmani</i> of Austen, is found in Angola, Gambia, the Katanga district
of the Congo Free State, the Matondwi Islands of Tanganyika, etc.</p></div>


<p class="spec"><b>Glossina morsitans</b>, Westwood.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This species has been shown by Kinghorn and Yorke, and also by Bruce, to be
responsible for the transmission of <i>Trypanosoma rhodesiense</i>, the micro-organism
producing sleeping sickness in man in Rhodesia and Nyasaland and also in parts
of German and Portuguese East Africa. Fisher and Taute have demonstrated
experimentally that <i>Trypanosoma gambiense</i>&mdash;the sleeping sickness parasite of other
parts of Africa&mdash;may also be transmitted by this fly, and in addition it is known to
be capable of disseminating several species of trypanosomes pathogenic to animals.
Of these, <i>T. brucei</i> (=? <i>T. rhodesiense</i>), the parasite of tsetse disease, first
incriminated by Bruce, is perhaps the most important.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Fig. 420.</span>&mdash;The tsetse-fly (<i>Glossina morsitans</i>, Westwood).</p></div>
</div>

<p>[It is the most widely spread of all tsetse-flies; its range extends from Senegambia
in the north-west to Southern Kordofan and Southern Abyssinia in the
north-east, and then southwards to the Bechuanaland Protectorate, North-eastern
Transvaal and Zululand. The actual localities given by Austen are Gambia, French
Guinea, Gold Coast, Togoland, Dahomey, Northern Nigeria, Congo Free State, the
Bahr-el-Ghazal, the Uganda Protectorate, German East Africa, and Portuguese East
Africa.</p>

<p>[This species is confined to âbelts,â often of very limited extent, and appears
to prefer regions where there is sufficient vegetation for moderate but not excessive
cover and a hot, moderately dry climate. It is not nearly so dependent upon<span class="pagenum" title="609"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609"></a></span>
water as is <i>G. palpalis</i>, and generally is most active in a dry atmosphere; some
observers, however, state that in certain districts it is more common along the
banks and edges of rivers. This tsetse-fly has been taken as high as 5,500&nbsp;ft.
altitude. It infests native villages as well as the bush. Like other tsetse-flies
it bites not only during the hottest part of the day, but also on bright warm moonlight
nights, and it feeds on the blood of all mammals.</p>

<p>[The structure of the male genitalia of those representatives of <i>G. morsitans</i>
occurring on the West Coast of Africa and in parts of the Soudan presents certain
constant differences from that of the typical form of this species; this form is
known as <i>G. morsitans</i>, race <i>submorsitans</i>, Newst.</p></div>


<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Stomoxys</b>, Geoffroy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The members of this genus which occur in temperate and tropical countries
are provided with a hard, slender, shiny black proboscis which projects horizontally
from beneath the head; by means of this structure they can bite severely.
In general appearance they resemble house flies, but the proboscis at once
distinguishes them. In many parts of Britain they are known as storm flies
on account of their frequent appearance indoors previous to a storm of rain or
wind, which I have invariably found to be correct; they are also called stinging
flies. In colour they are greyish, dusky or brownish-grey or black, varying from
5 to 7&nbsp;mm. in length; the thorax has dark longitudinal stripes and the abdomen
dark spots or bands. In the male the eyes are closer together than in the female.
These flies usually occur in stables and farmyards, along woods and in lanes, and
mainly attack mammals.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[One species (<i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i>, LinnÃ¦us) occurs practically all over the world.
The female lays her eggs in moist, warm, decaying vegetation; as many as eighty
may be laid by a single female. The ova are white, banana-shaped, with a broad
groove on the shorter curvature; they may hatch in two or three days. The
creamy-white larva tapers to a point at the head end, and is truncated at the tail
end. Two black mouth hooks are plainly visible at the cephalic extremity. There
are two plates on the posterior surface of the last segment which bear the respiratory
pores, nearly circular in outline. It reaches maturity in fourteen to twenty-one
days; when mature it is 11&nbsp;mm. long. The pupal stage is passed in the old larva<span class="pagenum" title="610"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610"></a></span>
skin and lasts from nine to thirteen days; it is barrel-shaped, 5 to 8&nbsp;mm. long, and
of a bright reddish-brown to dark chestnut-brown colour.</p>

<p>[This insect may act as a carrier of anthrax, and has been proved to be the agent
of an extensive epidemic of malignant pustule in the Isle of Pines, New Caledonia.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a></p>

<p>[NoÃ¨âs<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> experiments tend to show that it is an intermediate host and transmitter
of <i>Filaria labiato-papillosa</i> of the ox.</p>

<p>[Surra is generally stated to be transmitted by Stomoxys as well as Tabanus,
and yet Nitzman in the Philippines obtained uniformly negative results in exhaustive
experiments. Others have also been unsuccessful. Certainly Stomoxys can transmit
the disease in French West Africa (Bonet and Roubaud), and mechanically has
been proved to be capable of disseminating other trypanosomes (experimentally):
sleeping sickness (<i>T. gambiense</i>); nagana (<i>T. brucei</i>); souma (<i>T. cazalboui</i>); and
el debat (<i>T. soudanense</i>).</p>

<p>[<i>S. calcitrans</i> may also be a carrier of poliomyelitis (Rosenau and Brues,
<i>Harvard Alumni Bulletin</i>, 1912, xv, No. 9, pp.&nbsp;140â142). Several species are
now known (<i>S. brunnipes</i>, GrÃ¼nb.; <i>S. inornata</i>, GrÃ¼nb.; <i>S. nigra</i>, Macq.;
<i>S. omega</i>, Newst.; <i>S. ochrosoma</i>, Speiser, etc.).</p></div>


<p class="spec">Genus. <b>Lyperosia</b>, Rondani.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[A genus of small flies which bite man and animals, but are not so far connected
with the transmission of any disease in man, but in Java it appears to carry surra
(P. Schat, <i>Meeledeel Praefstation Oost-Java</i>, 1903, 3e ser., No. 44), the species being
<i>Lyperosia exigua</i>, Meijere. These flies can be told from Stomoxys by the palpi
being broader, flattened laterally, and as long, or nearly so, as the proboscis.
When not feeding the palpi enclose the proboscis, as in Glossina. They are usually
about half the size of Stomoxys, and are the smallest blood-sucking <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>.
They frequently swarm around and upon domesticated animals.</p>

<p>[The life-history of the horn fly in America (<i>L. irritans</i>, Linn.) is well known.
It lays its ova singly in freshly dropped cow-dung, and there the maggots feed,
pupating in the soil beneath.</p>

<p>[Patton and Cragg also give some details as to the life-history of <i>Liperosia
exigua</i> (âMedical Entomology,â p.&nbsp;375) as follows: â<i>L. exigua</i>, whose habits
have been observed in Madras, usually lays twelve eggs at a time. The flies
immediately return to the cow and the process is repeated when the dung is again
dropped. The larvÃ¦ migrate from the dung when about to pupate, and the puparia
are always found in the earth at some distance away or under the sides of the patch
of dung. The fly usually hatches out in five days, though sometimes as late as the
eighth. Weiss has studied the life-history of <i>irritans</i> var. <i>weisii</i> from Algeria;
its larval stage lasts five days, and the flies hatch out of the puparia in another
five days.â</p>

<p>[The other biting genera of <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>, HÃ¦matobia, HÃ¦matobosca, Bdellolarynx,
Stygeromyia, and PhilÃ¦matomyia, although sometimes annoying to man, have
not in any way been connected with any disease.</p>

<p>[The horse fly (<i>HÃ¦matobia irritans</i>, L.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a>) attacks cattle chiefly, but now and then
man is bitten. The different species can be told from Stomoxys by the palpi being
nearly as long as the proboscis.</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="611"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611"></a></span>
<p>[The genus <b>PhilÃ¦matomyia</b>, Austen, is intermediate between Stomoxys and
Musca in structure, and between the non-blood-sucking Musca, as <i>M. domestica</i>,
and the blood-sucking <i>Musca pattoni</i>, Austen, which feeds on the blood exuding
from the bites of true blood-suckers. They occur in Central Africa and India,
Ceylon and Cyprus (<i>vide</i> âThe Life-history of <i>PhilÃ¦matomyia insignis</i>, Austen,â
<i>Ann. Trop. Med. and Par.</i>, 1912, v, p.&nbsp;515).</p>

<p>[Two flies belonging to the family <b>AnthomyidÃ¦</b> also attack man, <span class="nowrap">namely:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>[<i>HydrotÃ¦a meteorica</i>, L. (the meteoric fly). This fly attacks man as well as
animals. They especially bite around the eyes and nostrils of animals, but are not
so particular with man; the head, however, is usually chosen. LinnÃ¦us called it
the meteoric fly because it often forms clouds around horsesâ heads at the approach
of rain. The HydrotÃ¦as are usually black or blue-black in colour with bare eyes
and simple abdomen, the front femora peculiarly constructed. <i>H. meteorica</i>, L.,
occurs in Britain.</p>

<p>[The members of the genus Hydrophoria, Desvoidy, also bite man.</p></div>


<p class="ph1"><b>Pupipara</b> or <b>EproboscidÃ¦</b>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The <i>Pupipara</i> are all blood-suckers, the majority occurring as parasites on
mammals and birds, where they are more or less permanent parasites. Occasionally
some may attack man. They all produce their young fully formed, and they assume
the pupal stage immediately after extrusion. The puparia are large. They are
mostly flat, louse-like flies which may or may not be winged. In the case of Melophagus
I have found the puparia are often passed by the female. The winged forms
have a short quick flight, and when disturbed will seek shelter in manâs hair or
beard. Two main families occur: (1) the <i>HippoboscidÃ¦</i>, and (2) the <i>NycteribiidÃ¦</i>.
The former occur on animals and birds, the latter on bats only, but may invade
man. Two other families are known&mdash;the <i>BraulidÃ¦</i> (bee parasites) and the <i>StreblidÃ¦</i>
(bat parasites).</p>

<p>[The mouth of the <i>HippoboscidÃ¦</i> is long and sharp, forming a proboscis. The
thorax and abdomen are flat and leathery. The legs are stout and strong, and
terminate in large dentate claws and other structures of use in holding on to the
hair or feathers of their host when blood-sucking.</p>

<p>[Austen says it is probable that the <i>HippoboscidÃ¦</i> are descended from ancestors
belonging to the <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>, which underwent modification in bodily structure as the
consequence of the adoption of a parasitic mode of life.</p>

<p>[Two wings are present in the true HippoboscÃ¦, <i>Hippobosca equina</i> (of the horse),
<i>H. camelina</i> (of the camel), <i>H. maculata</i> (of oxen), and <i>H. capensis</i> (of dogs), but
are absent in Melophagus, the sheep tick or ked fly (<i>M. ovinus</i>).</p>

<p>[In two genera, Lipoptena and Echestypus, wings are at first present, but are
lost as soon as the fly finds its permanent host.</p>

<p>[With regard to their biting man, such is only occasional. I have known sheep
shearers to be badly bitten by <i>Melophagus ovinus</i>, and have more than once been
attacked myself when standing where shearing is taking place. Sharp records the
grouse parasite, <i>Ornithomyia lagopodis</i>, as once biting severely a gamekeeper in
Scotland. There are also records of <i>H. maculata</i> biting man in Africa and India.</p>

<p>[Although so far not connected with any human disease, it is interesting to note
Theiler has shown that <i>Hippobosca rufipes</i>, v. Olfers, and <i>H. maculata</i>, Leach, are
capable of transmitting <i>Trypanosoma theileri</i>, Laveran, the cause of gall sickness
amongst cattle in the Transvaal. It is now considered, however, that <i>Trypanosoma
theileri</i> is non-pathogenic, and that the cause of gall sickness is a piroplasma-like
organism known as <i>Anaplasma marginale</i>. Theiler, Laveran and<span class="pagenum" title="612"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612"></a></span>
Mesnil all hold this view (<i>vide</i> Laveran and Mesnil, âTrypanosomes and Trypanosomiases,â
second edition, 1912, p.&nbsp;330).</p>

<p>[<i>Lynchia.</i>&mdash;Three members of this genus have been shown to transmit the
non-pathogenic (?) organism, <i>HÃ¦moproteus columbÃ¦</i> amongst pigeons in Algeria
and S. America.</p></div>


<p class="ph2">Insects and Epidemic Poliomyelitis.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[In a recent number of the <i>Journal of Economic Entomology</i>,<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> Brues and
Sheppard point out the possibility of acute epidemic poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis)
being an insect-borne disease. They summarize as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>[Many facts connected with the distribution of cases and the spread of epidemics
of this disease with histories of insects bites, suggest at least that the disease may
be insect-borne. Field work during the past summer, together with a consideration
of the epidemiology of the disease so far known, points strongly towards biting
flies as possible carriers of the virus. It seems probable that the common stable
fly (<i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i>, L.) may be responsible to a certain extent for the spread
of acute epidemic poliomyelitis, possibly aided by other biting flies such as
<i>Tabanus lineola</i>. No facts which disprove such a hypothesis have as yet been
adduced, and experiments based upon it are now in progress.</p>

<p>[If the disease should prove to be common to any species of domestic animals,
as is now strongly suspected, a secondary connection of ticks in spreading the
disease among such animals seems probable, as has been mentioned.</p>

<p><b>Akamushi or Kedani Sickness</b> (<i>vide</i> also p.&nbsp;487).&mdash;Schuffner (Far
East. Assoc. Trop. Med., <i>Compt. rend. Trois. Cong. Biennial</i>, 1913,
Saigon, 1914, pp.&nbsp;309â315) states he observed a peculiar fever in Deli,
Sumatra, somewhat resembling typhoid. This he traced either to a
mite or tick. He figures the possible carriers, namely, a Trombidium
and <i>CheyletidÃ¦</i>. He calls this disease pseudo-typhus&mdash;a variant of
Japanese kedani sickness, which, he says, also occurs in the Philippines.</p>

<p><b>Ticks.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">African Tick Fever</span>: Marzinovsky (<i>Proc. of Conference of
Bacteriologists and Representatives of Medical Sanitary Authorities on
the Campaign against Infectious Diseases in connection with the War,
Soc. Russ. Physicians in mem. Pirosov</i>, Moscow, 1915, pp.&nbsp;56â68), states
that African tick fever has been imported into Persia, and that it is
there carried by <i>Ornithodorus tholosani</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick Paralysis</span>: Todd (âParalysis and Tick-bite,â <i>Can. Med.
Assoc. Journ.</i>, 1914, iv, No. 9, pp.&nbsp;825â826) refers to paralysis ascribed
to the bites of ticks in children, and possibly adults, in America,
British Columbia and Australia. He states that a young child,
perfectly well one day, has more or less complete paresis or paralysis
on the next, fever, a rapid pulse, and other constitutional symptoms.
The child may be dull and stupid, and may have convulsions. If
the tick is not found and removed the child may die, but if it is
removed, the symptoms disappear and recovery is complete in a
few hours. The tick must be entirely removed.</p>

<p><b>Diptera.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">PsychodidÃ¦</span>: Bolt (<i>China Med. Journ.</i>, Shanghai,
xxix, No. 2, pp.&nbsp;78â86) states that sand-flies (Plebotomus) and the
fever due to them are common in North China, May and June being
the worst months. The natives of the region appear to be immune,
but all others suffer. Old ruined buildings are the favourite haunts
of the Phlebotomus. The species of Phlebotomus has not been
determined.</p>

Mal. Ven.</i>, Milan, 1914, xlix, pp.&nbsp;465â472) frequently to carry leprosy
and he points out that the early lesions of leprosy usually appear
on the uncovered parts of the body. This flea also attacks rats.</p>

Tasmania</i> for 1914, 1915, pp.&nbsp;35â74), describes a new blood-sucking
Leptid, <i>Spaniopsis tabaniformis</i>, which resembles a small gad fly
(Tabanus) in appearance.</p>

<p><i>Pycnosoma putorium</i>: This is believed by Roubaud (âLes Producteurs
de Myiases et Agents similaires chez lâhomme et les animaux,â
Paris, 1914, part I) to be largely concerned in the spread of
amÅbic dysentery in French West Africa.</p>

<p><i>Lucilia argyrocephala</i>, Macquart: This green-bottle fly is described
by Roubaud as producing myiasis in Africa (âLes Producteurs de
Myiases et Agents similaires chez lâhomme et les animaux,â 1914,
Paris, part I). It attacks ulcers and sores in man and animals.</p>

<p><i>Auchmeromyia luteola</i>, Fabr.: Schwetz (<i>Ann. Trop. Med. and Par.</i>,
1914, viii, No. 3, pp.&nbsp;497â507), collected a large quantity of this
insect at Kabinda. He placed them in flasks with sand and a few
days later they pupated, and in fifteen days several flies hatched
out. The larval period varies from an unknown minimum up to
several months. The larva may live for at least two months without
food. A female oviposited on the 17th, and on the 18th one larva
hatched. The pupal stage seems to last eight to fifteen days. The
larvÃ¦ appear to bite by day as well as night according to native
information.</p>

<p><i>Cordylobia anthropophaga</i>, GrÃ¼nb.: Roubaud (âEtudes sur la
Faune parasitaire de lâAfrique occidentale franÃ§aise,â part I, âLes
Producteurs des Myiases et Agents similaires chez lâhomme et les
animaux,â Paris, 1914) gives the life-history of this species. One
fly laid 150 ova in a glass vessel, on the sides, and on some rotten
fruit, and died the following day. He found that fifteen larvÃ¦ just
hatched placed on sand in a glass vessel with a guinea-pig gave rise
to characteristic tumours on the ventral surface of the body and
the anus. Other experiments failed. It thus seems that infection
takes place from larvÃ¦ which have hatched apart from the host.
Infection of man is regarded as accidental; no positive infection of
horses, oxen, sheep or pigs is known&mdash;it is rare in goats, and poultry
never seem to be attacked. The result of experiments tends to show
that the apparent choice of a host is mainly a question of body
temperature. The larva, whether freshly emerged or eight to ten days
old, penetrates the skin immediately, boring obliquely between the
epidermis and dermis. Once removed from the tumour the maggot
cannot bore again. The first moult takes place about three days
after penetration, and the total period of residence in the host is
seven to eight days. Upon emerging the larva falls to the ground
and buries itself. In two or three days it pupates and this stage lasts
no longer than twenty days. High temperatures, such as 95Â°&nbsp;F.,
appear to be fatal.</p>

<i>Sarcophaga carnarÃ­a</i>, L.; <i>Wohlfartia magnifica</i>, Schiner; <i>Chrysomyia
macellaria</i>, F.; <i>Calliphora vomitoria</i>, L.; and <i>Anthomyia pluvialis</i>, L.
He refers to a severe myiasis in Russia, due to a fly variously
recorded as <i>Sarcophaga wohlfarti</i>, Rond.; <i>S. ruralis</i>, Meig.; or <i>Sarcophila
meigeni</i>, Portsch. These are all probably synonyms of
<i>W. magnifica</i>. <i>Chrysomyia macellaria</i>, in Central America and
South America, is quite as harmful as <i>S. carnaria</i>, causing perforation
of the tympanum and meningitis. <i>Lucilia nobilis</i> and <i>L. cÃ¦sar</i>
have also been incriminated. Of the sub-family <i>AnthomyinÃ¦</i>, the
larvÃ¦ of <i>Fannia scalaris</i>, Meig., <i>F. canicularis</i>, Meig., <i>F. incisurata</i>,
Zett, and <i>HydrotÃ¦a meteorica</i>, L., are chiefly associated with
myiasis. He recommends, if the larvÃ¦ are outside the tympanum,
an injection of chloroform vapour by a few drops of water saturated
with chloroform, by an emulsion of 5 per cent. carbon bisulphide
or with benzine. When detached they may be removed with forceps
or a solution of boric acid. If the tympanum has been perforated,
the larvÃ¦ must be removed at once.</p>

in 96 per cent. alcohol as an efficient method of keeping the body
free of lice. But the process must be renewed each time the linen is
washed and it takes fifteen minutes to carry out. On adding the
oil to the alcohol, a portion of the former is precipitated, the supernatant
fluid is decanted and poured over the linen, which is wrung
out in it and dried. The garments retain their lice-proof properties
until washed. Three days after wearing the clothes thus treated no
lice remain on the body.</p>

<p><i>Pediculus capitis</i> and <i>Phthirus pubis</i> are shown to be successfully
controlled by applying spirit extract of sabadilla and both white and
grey mercury ointment, solution of corrosive sublimate of a strength
of 1 in 250 to 1 in 100, amyl and ethyl alcohol, benzine, chloroform,
carbon tetrachloride, methane, birch tar, liquid of malinin, etc. The
control of <i>Pediculus vestimenti</i> by the mixture of tartaric acid and
sodium sulphite slightly moistened with water is advised. It is placed
in small linen bags underneath the shirt; the heat of the body produces
a reaction which continues for two days, giving off a large amount of
SO<sub>2</sub>, which spreads beneath the shirt and kills all the parasites but does
not affect the skin. Marzinovsky, in the same <i>Proceedings</i> (pp.&nbsp;56â68),
gives a number of remedies for <i>Pediculus vestimenti</i> (called <i>humanus</i>),
and mentions quinine or mercury, which latter the natives in Turkestan
carry on their hands and legs in bracelets soaked in mercury
compounds. He also mentions ethereal oils, the most effective being
clove oil, eucalyptus, oil of anise and camphor. He recommends for
disinfecting clothing for army purposes the chamber used by the
Japanese on a large scale. Kummerfeldsâ wash is advised, and is prepared
as follows: 20 parts of precipitated sulphur are incorporated in
a mortar with 50 parts of glycerine; 2 parts of camphor are separately
ground with 50 of eau-de-Cologne and 20 of borax, and 870 parts of
distilled water are added; the whole is mixed together and 3 drops of
an extract of musk are added; shake in order to prevent the sulphur
settling down; 50 parts of ether are added to the mixture. This
sounds an expensive and troublesome preparation to make.</p>

African troops were supplied by the Government with bags of flowers
of sulphur sewn in small calico bags and secured to the underclothing
next the skin as a preventive of lice. The bags were 2&nbsp;in. square,
one on the trunk and one against each leg. This is a generally
accepted preventive, but is best mixed with equal parts of creosote

parasites of man, the number of which is very large. The Protozoa
that infest man are very important, and the literature relating to them
and to the treatment of the diseases that they produce is very extensive.
All that can be done in this Appendix is to give a very brief
outline of some of the more recent and approved methods of treatment,
for further details of which the reader should refer to standard
medical works, among which the following are <span class="nowrap">noteworthy:&mdash;</span></p>

<h5><b>I.&mdash;AMÅBIC DYSENTERY</b>.</h5>

<p>AmÅbic dysentery, due to <i>EntamÅba histolytica</i> (see pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_34">34</a>â41),
is present throughout the tropical world and also occurs in temperate
zones.</p>

<p>Walker and Sellards<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> (1913) conducted important experiments
with amÅbÃ¦ on prisoners in the Philippine Islands. They showed
experimentally that cultural amÅbÃ¦ are non-pathogenic. As regards
experiments with <i>EntamÅba coli</i>, after feeding to twenty individuals
they concluded that <i>E. coli</i> is a parasite of the human intestine but
non-pathogenic and non-culturable. In a third series of experiments,
after feeding with motile <i>EntamÅba histolytica</i>, tetragena cysts were
found in the stools later; when tetragena cysts were administered,
motile <i>E. histolytica</i> were present in the subsequent stools. Some of
the histolytica cases developed dysentery after a time. They lay stress
on the necessity for the frequent examination of stools in order to
detect carriers. The incubation period of entamÅbic dysentery is
usually long.</p>

<p>With regard to the symptomatology of amÅbic dysentery, Castellani
and Chalmers distinguish four types&mdash;the acute, chronic, latent, and
mixed types.</p>

<p>The acute type has an abrupt onset; pain is felt in the lower part
of the abdomen, and the motions, rarely exceeding thirty daily, are
accompanied by much griping and straining. Blood and mucus are
present in the motions, and occasionally greyish material, consisting
of leucocytes, mucus, Charcot-Leyden crystals, amÅbÃ¦, and bacteria,
sometimes with particles of tissue. Nausea and vomiting may occur.
Digestion is usually deranged. The abdomen is sunken, the liver and
spleen are normal, but tenderness is felt along the course of the large
intestine. The urine may be diminished in quantity.</p>

<p>The chronic type may succeed the acute, or appear like diarrhÅa,
the motions being fÃ¦culent and containing mucus. Between exacerbations,
constipation may occur. The number of motions may only be
twelve to fourteen per diem. Gangrenous complications may occur
at any time, and chronic dysentery may persist for many years.</p>

<p>The latent type is important, as the patients, though free from
dysenteric symptoms, harbour amÅbÃ¦ and act as parasite carriers.
The latent condition may lead to acute attacks or to liver abscess.</p>

<p>The mixed type occurs where amÅbic and bacillary dysentery are
combined. There is much fever, nausea, and vomiting. The motions
are numerous and often very offensive.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The most modern method of treatment, due to
Leonard Rogers, is by emetine. According to Castellani and
Chalmers, it is well to relieve griping and straining by either a hypodermic
injection of morphia or by small enemata of 40 minims of<span class="pagenum" title="619"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619"></a></span>
laudanum in 1&nbsp;oz. of mucilage of starch or by using <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span>&nbsp;gr. morphia
or <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span>&nbsp;gr. codeine suppository. A dose of castor oil (Êiv to Êvi) with
or without a few minims of liquor opii sedativus or a few doses of
saline may be given during the first twenty-four hours. After the
castor oil has acted or simultaneously, emetine treatment should be
commenced; <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">3</span></span></span> to <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&nbsp;gr. of emetine hydrochloride, dissolved in sterile
normal salt solution, is injected hypodermically three times a day for
two or three days.</p>

<p>If emetine cannot be obtained, 5&nbsp;gr. doses of ipecacuanha every
three to six hours in the form of membroids, or as pills coated with
salol or keratin, can be substituted.</p>

<p>After acute symptoms have disappeared, intestinal irrigations once
or twice daily, on alternate days, are useful. A solution of tannic acid
(3 to 5 per 1,000) or of quinine bihydrochloride varying in strength
from 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 750 is very slowly injected in quantities of
<span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> to 3 pints by means of a long, soft, rectal tube.</p>

<p>For gangrenous dysentery Castellani and Chalmers state that
appendicostomy, with irrigation of the whole lower bowel with
quinine lotion (1 in 1,000) or collargol (1 in 500), is the only chance.</p>

<p>The use of emetine should be continued in smaller doses after the
dysenteric symptoms have ceased, in order to prevent relapses and as
a possible safeguard against the development of a liver abscess.</p>

<p>Recently (July, 1914), Dr. W.&nbsp;E. Deeks<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> has given an account of
his successful procedure in dealing with the dysenteries in the Ancon
Hospital, Panama Canal Zone, of which medical clinic he is the chief.
With regard to amÅbic dysentery he advocates: (1) Rest, to increase
the patientâs resistance; (2) a generous milk diet, which is practically
all absorbed before it reaches the large bowel; (3) saline or plain
water irrigations, one to three daily; (4) the administration of
bismuth sub-nitrate in heroic doses; 180&nbsp;gr. is given mechanically
suspended in about a tumbler of plain or effervescent water every
three hours, day and night in severe cases, only lessening the amount
when improvement takes place. Mechanical suspension in a large
quantity of water is essential. When the stools begin to decrease in
number and the tongue becomes clean, the number of doses is reduced
to three or four daily. In very chronic cases one or two doses daily
for a month after convalescence are recommended.</p>

<p>In exceptional cases of extreme emaciation and exhaustion,
showing marked toxic symptoms, surgical treatment is necessary,
and at Ancon a wide, open cÃ¦costomy is performed.</p>

<p>The treatment of dysentery with bismuth sub-nitrate has been in
use for some years at Ancon. Latterly, a combined treatment by
hypodermic injections of emetine and bismuth sub-nitrate by the<span class="pagenum" title="620"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620"></a></span>
mouth has been used, and the authorities there consider that it is
better to combine the two drugs rather than use each singly. Emetine
probably acts as a direct poison to the amÅbÃ¦, while the bismuth
probably acts by destroying the symbiotic organisms necessary for
their growth.</p>

<p>With regard to preventive measures, all drinking water should be
filtered and boiled, and uncooked vegetables and salads avoided.
Scrupulous care with regard to personal cleanliness, and avoidance
of touching the mouth or lips after contact with dysenteric patients,
are essential. Isolation of parasite carriers is of great use in combating
and controlling outbreaks of amÅbic dysentery. The pollution
of soil and water must be rigorously prevented.</p>

<p>Liver abscess due to amÅbÃ¦ must be localized by exploratory
punctures, and then opened and drained. Intramuscular injections
of emetine hydrochloride, <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">6</span></span></span>&nbsp;gr. to <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&nbsp;gr. every day, will reduce the
temperature and afford relief.</p>

<p>Oral endamÅbiasis has been recently investigated by Bass and
Johns, Smith and Barrett and colleagues (see pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_43">43</a>, <a href="#Page_733">733</a>). It responds
to treatment with emetine, and <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&nbsp;gr. of emetine hydrochloride
administered hypodermically each day is of service. Rinsing the
mouth with a solution of fluid extract of ipecacuanha is also useful.</p>

<p>Rogers<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> (1915) recommends a combined treatment of emetine
and streptococcal vaccines for pyorrhÅa alveolaris.</p>


<h5>II.&mdash;TRYPANOSOMIASES.</h5>

<p>The human trypanosomiases are those occurring in Africa, due to
<i>Trypanosoma gambiense</i> and <i>T. rhodesiense</i> and spread by GlossinÃ¦,
and that due to <i>T. cruzi</i>, occurring in South America and spread
by the Reduviid bugs, <i>Triatoma</i> spp. These trypanosomiases present
different clinical features and are best dealt with separately.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>African Sleeping Sickness.</b></p>

<p>Sleeping sickness, due to <i>Trypanosoma gambiense</i> or varieties
thereof, was first reported from West Africa and is now present, not
only along the West Coast and in Nigeria, but throughout the Congo
basin into Uganda, north of which it exists in the Bahr-el-Ghazal
province of the Sudan. In Nyasaland and Rhodesia a more virulent but
less widely distributed disease is produced by <i>Trypanosoma rhodesiense</i>.</p>

<p>There is a general similarity between the two diseases, and the
symptoms as described by the leading authorities agree in the main.
The malady due to <i>T. rhodesiense</i> has been known only since 1910
and the differences between the malady due to it and to <i>T. gambiense</i>
will be indicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="621"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621"></a></span></p>

<p>The course of the disease may be roughly divided into three
stages, the incubation, the febrile or glandular, and the cerebral stage.</p>

<p>The exact incubation period is not known with certainty in man.
Probably, in most cases, it does not exceed two to three weeks, but
disease signs may not appear for months. The bite of the Glossina
gives rise to local irritation, which may be overlooked. The irritation
usually subsides in the course of a few days.</p>

<p>The febrile, or glandular stage, is marked by attacks of fever of an
intermittent type. An erythematous eruption is often found on Europeans.
This rash begins as irregularly shaped pinkish patches which
clear in the centre until a ring is produced. It may occur on any
part of the body but is more frequent on the trunk. A typical
symptom is the enlargement of one or more of the lymphatic glands,
especially those of the neck. A general, deep hyperÃ¦sthesia, known
as Kerandelâs sign, may be present, and if the patient strikes a limb
against any hard object, a feeling of acute pain is felt, the sensation
being slightly delayed. As repeated attacks of fever increase, the
patient may become anÃ¦mic. The febrile stage may last for years,
and cure may be brought about at this phase, but frequently, after the
febrile stage has lasted some time, the cerebral stage is reached.
Tachycardia is also a symptom. Auto-agglutination of the red blood
corpuscles is another useful characteristic, as it is said to occur rarely
in other tropical diseases, but some workers doubt its value.</p>

<p>The cerebral, or true sleeping sickness stage is marked by a great
change in the habits of the victim, who becomes apathetic and dull,
careless and dirty in habits, and begins to experience difficulty in
walking. Tremors of varying degrees of severity are common and
the gait is peculiar. There is usually fever with rise of temperature
from 100Â°&nbsp;F. to 104Â°&nbsp;F. in the evening, becoming subnormal in the
morning. For some days before death, it often becomes permanently
subnormal. Congestion and Ådema of the lungs, with patches of
pneumonia, are not infrequently observed before death. The torpor
gradually deepens, and the patient loses flesh. Frequently the lips
swell and saliva dribbles. The patient usually becomes comatose and
death ensues. Mania and delusions, and psychical and physical
symptoms resembling those found in general paralysis of the insane,
sometimes occur, and death may arise from secondary complications
such as pneumonia or dysentery.</p>

<p>Pathologically, the disease seems to consist of a chronic inflammation
of the lymphatic system. The trypanosomes reach the
lymphatic glands which become inflamed, and gradually invade the
blood and the cerebrospinal fluid. Sooner or later, as a result of
the lymphatic disease, changes occur in the membranes and
substances of the brain and spinal cord. There is round-celled
perivascular infiltration of the pia-arachnoid of the brain and spinal<span class="pagenum" title="622"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622"></a></span>
cord. These changes cause compression of the blood-vessels, and
so lessen the supply of blood to the brain and spinal cord. Further
changes in the latter organs result in the production of the symptoms
that have given the disease the name of âsleeping sickness.â</p>

<p>The disease due to <i>Trypanosoma rhodesiense</i> generally runs a more
rapid course than that due to <i>T. gambiense</i>. The torpor and sleepiness
may not be obvious or be very slight, and the enlargement of
the lymphatic glands of the neck also may not be marked or may
appear to be absent. The duration of the disease often appears
to be from three to six months.</p>

<p>Treatment is only of use if commenced in the earlier stages of
the disease. The substances of most value so far are arsenic in
the form of atoxyl (introduced by Wolferstan Thomas in 1905) and
antimony in the form of tartar emetic. Castellani and Chalmers and
Manson recommend treatment by combining the use of both substances.
The combined treatment is recommended not only because both substances
have been proved of service independently, but also because
certain strains of trypanosomes resistant to arsenic are known, and
trypanosomes can develop a resistance to arsenic. Such forms, that
would not be affected by the atoxyl, are left open to attack by the
antimony salt. Daniels also recommends combined arsenic and
antimony treatment, and (1915) uses atoxyl and antiluetin.</p>

<p>Atoxyl is best given intramuscularly in 10 per cent. solution in sterile
normal saline solution. Galyl is also said to have given good results.</p>

<p>Castellani and Chalmers recommend: (1) Mansonâs method of
administration of atoxyl, viz., 2 to 3&nbsp;gr. of atoxyl are given by
intramuscular injection every third day for at least two years; or
(2) Broden and Rodhainâs method, <span class="nowrap">7â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&nbsp;gr. of atoxyl by intramuscular
injection every fifth day. For the combined therapy by atoxyl and
antimony they recommend the following:&mdash;âAn atoxyl injection
(3&nbsp;gr.) is given every third day or <span class="nowrap">7â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&nbsp;gr. every fifth day, and sodiotartrate
of antimony (Plimmerâs salt) is administered daily, 2&nbsp;gr.
dissolved in a large quantity of water (2 pints) by the mouth or
by the rectum. Tartar emetic, however, is best given by intravenous
injections, using solutions of 1 in 100 or 1 in 1,000. The dose of
the drug to be given is 5 to 10 cg. per injection. It is important
that none of the fluid of the injection should escape into the
surrounding tissues, as a violent inflammation may result. These
injections should be administered monthly on ten consecutive days
for a long period.â</p>

<p>Macfie and Gallagher (1914) injected 6&nbsp;gr. of atoxyl intramuscularly
every week in cases infected with <i>T. nigeriense</i> in the Eket
district of Southern Nigeria.</p>

<p>Large doses of atoxyl were often said to cause distressing results<span class="pagenum" title="623"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623"></a></span>
such as optic atrophy, and when the onset of such occurred the drug was
usually discontinued. However, Daniels<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> (July, 1915) points out that
eye troubles, such as iridocyclitis, are symptoms of trypanosomiasis.</p>

<p>Other arsenical preparations such as soamin and arsenophenylglycin
have been used, but less successfully than atoxyl. Fowlerâs solution,
well diluted, has been given by the mouth when treatment by injection
was not possible, the doses commencing with 5 minims and increasing
to 15 minims.</p>

<p>Salvarsan and neo-salvarsan have also been tried for sleeping
sickness. Plimmer recommended powdered antimony suspended
in sterile olive oil. Ranken used precipitated metallic antimony in
normal saline solution injected intravenously.</p>

<p>Laveran and Thiroux have recommended a combined treatment
of atoxyl and an inorganic salt of arsenic such as orpiment. The
orpiment is given as pills, in doses of 2&nbsp;gr. of orpiment two or three
times daily. Opium is added to the orpiment to prevent diarrhÅa.
This treatment is said to have been used in man with good results.</p>

<p><i>Trypanosoma rhodesiense</i> seems less amenable to treatment than
<i>T. gambiense</i>.</p>

<p>The main preventive measures seem to lie in segregation of the
sick in areas not infested with GlossinÃ¦, and in measures against these
flies, such as bush clearing and destruction, to some extent, of <i>proved</i>
reservoirs in big game.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>South American Trypanosomiasis</b>.</p>

<p>The chief clinical features of the trypanosomiasis occurring in
Brazil have already been indicated (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_87">87</a>). With regard to
treatment, according to Castellani and Chalmers the indications are
the same as those for African trypanosomiasis, together with treatment
for hypothyroidism. Preventive measures are directed against
the Reduviid bug, <i>Triatoma megista</i>, that transmits the disease. The
bugs occur in numbers in the cracks of the houses of the poor of
Minas Geraes, and may be destroyed by sulphur fumigation, lime-washing
or whitewashing.</p>


<h5>III.&mdash;FLAGELLATE DIARRHÅA AND DYSENTERY.</h5>

<p>The chief causal agents are <i>Trichomonas hominis</i> (<i>T. intestinalis</i>),
<i>Chilomastix</i> (<i>Tetramitus</i>) <i>mesnili</i> and allied organisms (see pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_54">54</a> to 57),
and <i>Lamblia intestinalis</i> (see pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_57">57</a> to 60 and Appendix pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_734">734</a> to 736).</p>

<p>These parasites and the associated diarrhÅas occur in temperate
as well as in warm climates. Probably some of the diarrhÅas in India
are thus caused. The same, or similar parasites occur in various
MuridÃ¦, especially rats and mice, which may act as reservoirs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="624"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624"></a></span></p>

<p>(i) Mello-Leitao<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> (1913), writing from Rio de Janeiro, states that
there is a primary flagellate dysentery, due to <i>Trichomonas intestinal</i>is
(Leuckart) and to <i>Lamblia intestinalis</i> (<i>Lambl</i>), either separately or in
combination. He considers it a benign disease, and the most frequent
form of dysentery in young children. Trichomonas and Lamblia
were found to be pathogenic to children under 3 years of age.</p>

<p>Escomel<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> (1913) collected 152 cases of dysentery in Peru due
solely to Trichomonas. Examination of the reservoirs containing
the water used for drinking purposes showed the presence of Trichomonas.
After the reservoirs were cleaned no more Trichomonas was
found and the cases of dysentery ceased.</p>

<p>Brumpt<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> (1912) described a colitis due to <i>Trichomonas intestinalis</i>
in a patient returned from Tonkin.</p>

<p>Cases of infection by <i>Chilomastix</i> (<i>Tetramitus</i>) <i>mesnili</i>, with colitis
or dysenteric symptoms, are recorded by Brumpt (1912) from France,
and by Nattan-Larrier<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> (1912) from the Ivory Coast respectively.</p>

<p>Marques da Cunha and Torres<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> (1914) describe five cases of
chronic diarrhÅa in Brazilian children due to the <i>Chilomastix</i>
(<i>Tetramitus</i>).</p>

<p>GÃ¤bel<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> (1914) described a case of seasonal diarrhÅa contracted in
Tunis and caused by a Tetramitid parasite which he named <i>DifÃ¤mus
tunensis</i>, as the discoverer considered that it lacked an undulating
membrane in its large cytostome.</p>

<p>Derrieu and Raynaud<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> (1914) record a case of chronic dysentery
in Algeria due to a Trichomonad possessing an undulating membrane
and five free flagella. The parasite was named <i>Hexamastix ardindelteili</i>,
but the generic name <i>Hexamastix</i> is pre-occupied. Chatterjeeâs
<i>Pentatrichomonas bengalensis</i> (1915) is possibly the same organism.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Escomel (1913), finding ipecacuanha and calomel
useless, recommends turpentine for Trichomonad dysentery. Two to
4&nbsp;gr of essence of turpentine in an emulsion are given by the mouth,
and enemata containing 15 to 20 drops of turpentine emulsified in
the yolk of an egg to which is added a little water and tincture of
opium. Derrieu and Raynaud found this treatment effective in Algeria.
Smithies<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> (1912) reports two cures of cases of severe dyspepsia, in
which Trichomonads were found in the stomach contents, after
administration of a single dose of 50 to 60&nbsp;gr. of thymol, given at
bed-time, together with 2&nbsp;gr. of calomel, and followed by an ounce
of Carlsbad salts in the morning. The patients came from the<span class="pagenum" title="625"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625"></a></span>
Southern United States, and had been in the habit of drinking
unfiltered surface water in the localities in which they lived. Mello-Leitao<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a>
used magnesium sulphate and water or milk diet. Sometimes
enemata of collargol (1 per cent.) or electrargol were required.
Rosenfeld recommended calomel. Methylene blue has also been
tried. Recently, Escomel<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> (1914) recommends enemata of an aqueous
solution of iodine (1 per 1,000) and farinaceous diet. Lynch<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> (1915),
working in South Carolina, recommends a mouth wash of saturated
solution of bicarbonate of soda three times daily in oral infections.
A similar solution was used as a douche in vaginal trichomoniasis.</p>

<p>Stiles (1913) points out that when amÅbÃ¦ or flagellates are found
in a large percentage (10 to 40, or even 60) of the members of a
community, means should be taken to improve the methods for the
disposal of the dejecta, so that the food supply may be carefully
protected against fÃ¦cal contamination. Cysts of the parasites may be
air-borne or conveyed to food on the bodies of house-flies.</p>

<p>(ii) <i>Lamblia intestinalis</i> in man may cause diarrhÅa with dysenteriform
stools. The diarrhÅa may be of a chronic recurrent character.
The flagellate, or a variety of it, is fairly common in the digestive tract
of rats and mice.</p>

<p>Mathis<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> (1914) gives an interesting account of cases in Tonkin.
In a child, aged 3, the stools were at first glairy and blood-stained,
containing many encysted Lamblia. The childâs home was infested
with mice. In another case, the house of the patient harboured
numerous rats.</p>

<p>According to Mathis, prognosis is favourable, but emetine hydrochloride
is without action on Lamblia. Prowazek and Werner<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a>
(1914), however, state that emetine will act upon the flagellates, but
not upon the cysts. They recommend uzara (two tablets, three times
daily) and extract of male fern as useful in certain cases. Martin
Mayer (1914) found emetine hydrochloride successful in a case in the
Hamburg Seamenâs Hospital, but Assmy (1914) points out that a
suitable diet and daily doses of magnesium sulphate are sufficient,
in his experience, to effect an improvement, and he doubts the specific
action of emetine. Escomel (1914) recommends milk diet, then
calomel succeeded by castor oil.</p>

<p>According to Noc, Lamblia may also be water-borne. Healthy
carriers of Lamblia cysts are known. Food should be protected
from being soiled by rats and mice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="626"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626"></a></span></p>


<h5>IV.&mdash;LEISHMANIASES.</h5>

<p class="tac">A.&emsp;<b>Kala-azar.</b></p>

<p class="tac">(i) <i>âIndianâ Kala-azar due to</i> Leishmania donovani.</p>

<p>Indian kala-azar due to <i>Leishmania donovani</i> is a very fatal disease
with a rate of mortality varying from 70 to 98 per cent. of the cases.</p>

<p>The incubation period is very variable and the early symptoms
not well defined. The incubation period seems to range from three
weeks to several months after exposure to infection. The onset seems
to commence with a rigor and attack of irregular, remittent fever, which
may show two remissions per day in a four-hourly temperature chart.
Rogers considers the daily double remission almost diagnostic. The
duration of this first attack is from two to six weeks. The spleen
and liver enlarge, especially the former, and are painful and tender.
Towards the end of the time the temperature declines and the first
period of the disease ends. After this period an apyrexial interval
occurs, which, after some weeks, ends in an attack of fever resembling
the first. Periods of pyrexia and apyrexia alternate. AnÃ¦mia commences
and asthenia appears and deepens steadily. The patient is
now thin and wasted, the abdomen much swollen and protuberant,
the ribs show clearly, the limbs are wasted and skin and tongue
darker than normal. In Europeans the skin is of a remarkable earthy
hue, and in natives of India darker than normal, approaching black.
Intestinal disturbances, often in the form of very obstinate and
intractable diarrhÅa or dysenteric attacks, are common. Papular
eruptions often appear, particularly on the thighs; hÃ¦morrhages also
may occur. The disease lasts for periods varying from seven months
to two years, and usually ends fatally.</p>

<p>Treatment, unfortunately, has not been very successful up to 1915.
Manson has reported two cases of cure by intramuscular injections of
atoxyl daily or every other day in doses of 3&nbsp;gr. Rogers has advocated
large doses of quinine, 60 to 90&nbsp;gr. daily until the temperature falls and
then 20&nbsp;gr. daily. Castellani and Chalmers consider the best results
are obtained by large doses of quinine given intramuscularly, supplemented
by a course of quinine cacodylate injections or atoxyl injections.
Tartar emetic should be tried (see pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_627">627</a>, <a href="#Page_629">629</a>), especially
as L. Rogers (July, 1915) has had promising results in ten cases.
Castellani (1914) and Mackie (1915), have also had successful results.
Leishman states that the administration of red bone-marrow, either
raw or in the form of tablets, may be beneficial. Good nursing and
careful diet are essential, and diarrhÅa or dysentery must receive the
appropriate treatment.</p>

<p>With regard to preventive measures, the extermination of bugs<span class="pagenum" title="627"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627"></a></span>
and other biting insects seems to be of most service. Domestic and
personal cleanliness is of great importance. Patients should be
segregated. It would probably be as well if houses in which many
cases of kala-azar occurred were destroyed. Dodds Price, in Assam
tea gardens, moves the coolie lines 300 to 800 yards from old infected
ones, with satisfactory results.</p>


<p class="tac">(ii) <i>Infantile Kala-azar due to</i> Leishmania infantum.</p>

<p>This malady is found among children, rarely in adults, along the
Mediterranean littoral.</p>

<p>The disease commences insidiously and is often unrecognized until
some intestinal disturbance occurs. The spleen is then found to be
somewhat enlarged, and the case has often been regarded as one of
malaria. The child becomes anÃ¦mic, suffers from diarrhÅa, alternating
with constipation, and has attacks of irregular fever. The spleen
continues to enlarge and protrudes from under the cover of the ribs.
HÃ¦morrhages from the nose and gums and into the skin occur.
AnÃ¦mia and wasting set in. The abdomen then becomes very
enlarged. The child becomes much less active both physically
and mentally, and looks prematurely old. Death often occurs from
exhaustion, though some cases of spontaneous recovery are known.</p>

<p>Treatment up till recently has been unsatisfactory. Some of the
remedies tried, as quoted by Castellani and Chalmers, are 15 cg. doses
of atoxyl, benzoate of mercury (2 to 4&nbsp;mg. as a daily injection),
thiarsol (5 to 15&nbsp;mg. by subcutaneous injection), salvarsan, etc.
Recently Cristina and Caronia (1915)<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> have given repeated intravenous
injections of 1 per cent. aqueous solution of tartar emetic, the dose
varying from 2 to 10 cg. The treatment in various cases has lasted
from 15 to 40 days.</p>

<p>Prophylactic measures seem to lie in the destruction of infected
dogs and diminishing the breeding of fleas (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_111">111</a>).</p>


<p class="ph1">B.&emsp;<b>Oriental Sore, due to Leishmania tropica.</b></p>

<p>Oriental sore, known under many other names (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_107">107</a>), is a
local infection of the skin due to <i>Leishmania tropica</i>. The incubation
period varies from a few days to some weeks, or even months, and
then one or several small itching papules appear. Each spot becomes
red and shotty, the papules increase slowly in size and the surface
becomes covered with papery scales. After a variable time, usually
not exceeding three to four months, ulceration occurs and a yellowish
secretion is exuded that soon dries into a scab. Under the scab
ulceration continues by erosion of the edges, and subsidiary sores
arise around the parent ulcer and usually fuse with it. Healing commences
after six to twelve months. Granulation begins at the centre<span class="pagenum" title="628"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628"></a></span>
and spreads outwards, and when healing is complete, a depressed,
whitish or pinkish scar remains.</p>

<p>Many treatments for Oriental sore have been devised but do not
seem particularly satisfactory. Castellani and Chalmers state that
the scabs should be removed by boracic acid fomentations, and the
ulcers thoroughly disinfected once or twice daily with a 1 per 1,000
solution of perchloride of mercury, after which an ordinary antiseptic
ointment is applied.</p>

<p>The use of permanganate of potash has been advocated both by
French and English doctors. Both large and small sores can be
treated. The patientâs skin around the sore is protected by a thick
layer of vaseline, and the surface of the ulcer powdered with potassium
permanganate, which is kept in position by a pad of gauze and a
bandage. The treatment is said to cause great pain for six to eight
hours, but at the most, three treatments are necessary before the sore
becomes a simple ulcer, well on the way to healing. The permanganate
may also be used in ointment. Excision of the ulcer when
small is advisable when the site of the ulcer permits of this. According
to Manson, reports on treatment by radium, salvarsan and carbon
dioxide snow are decidedly promising. Mitchell (1914)<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> reports
favourably on the use of carbon dioxide snow in the form of a pencil,
in India. In Brazil several workers (1914) record successful results
from the intravenous injection of a 1 per cent. solution of tartar
emetic in distilled water. Low (1915) has successfully treated a case by
direct local application of tartar emetic. Row (1912) has treated cases
of Oriental sore by inoculation of killed cultures of the causal organism.</p>

<p>As the disease is very contagious, the slightest wound, and any
insect bite, should be thoroughly disinfected with 5 per cent. carbolic
acid or iodine. Destruction of bugs, lice, and other biting insects
should be enforced. As dogs may contract the disease (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_108">108</a>),
it is well not to allow them in the house and not to encourage undue
contact with them.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>Naso-oral Leishmaniasis</i> (<i>Espundia</i>) <i>due to</i> Leishmania tropica.</p>

<p>This form of Leishmaniasis has been reported from South America
and recently by Christopherson<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> (1914) from the Sudan. In South
America it is often called Espundia, also Buba and Forestal Leishmaniasis.
The primary lesion is found usually on the forearms,
legs, chest or trunk. This ulcer is of the Oriental sore type, and
after some months, or even as long as two years, heals up, leaving a
thick scar. While the ulcer is open, or more often after it has healed,
lesions appear on the mucosa of the mouth and nose. The hard and<span class="pagenum" title="629"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629"></a></span>
soft palate, gums and lips all may be attacked. The mucosa of the
nose is usually attacked and the cartilages become destroyed, producing
great deformity. In bad cases the pharynx and larynx may
become infected.</p>

<p>Till recently it was believed that treatment was of little use unless
the case could be investigated early. Escomel considered that if the
primary cutaneous lesion was excised or destroyed, further progress
of the disease was prevented. When lesions have appeared on the
mucosa of the mouth or nose, little could be done. The ulcers might
be cauterized and mild antiseptic mouth washes used.</p>

<p>In 1913 Vianna, working in Brazil, introduced treatment by tartar
emetic, which is now becoming more widely known and proving
efficacious. Carini<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> (1914) applies it thus. Tartar emetic (that is,
potassium antimonyl tartrate) in 1 per cent. aqueous solution is introduced
slowly into a vein, such as the vein at the bend of the elbow,
in doses of 5 to 10&nbsp;c.c. daily or on alternate days according to the
tolerance of the patient to the drug. Eighteen to forty injections
have been used. In some of the memoirs on the subject, the drug is
referred to as antimony tartrate.</p>

<p>The course of the disease is chronic and may last for twenty to
thirty years, death usually resulting from some intercurrent disease.</p>

<p>At present the actual transmitter of Espundia is not known with
certainty. Various sand-flies (SimulidÃ¦) have been suspected of
transmitting the disease, though so far proof is wanting. It has also
been suggested that the natural food sources of some SimulidÃ¦ known
to bite man, namely, certain snakes<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> and lizards,<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> are possible
reservoirs of the disease.</p>

<p>Prophylactic measures would seem to consist in the immediate
disinfection of insect bites by tincture of iodine, and by avoidance of
areas known to be infested with snakes and lizards, and insects that
prey on them and man indifferently. The destruction of the primary
lesion as soon as detected is essential, and the isolation of advanced
cases of the disease seems advisable.</p>


<h5>V.&mdash;SPIROCHÃTOSES.</h5>

<p class="tac">A.&emsp;<b>Relapsing Fevers.</b></p>

<p>The relapsing fevers of Europe and of America, due to <i>SpirochÃ¦ta
recurrentis</i> and <i>S. novyi</i> (probably a race of <i>S. recurrentis</i>), present
much the same symptoms, which differ in some respects from those<span class="pagenum" title="630"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630"></a></span>
due to <i>S. duttoni</i>, the excitant of âtickâ or ârelapsingâ fever in
Africa (see pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_116">116</a>â122).</p>

<p>The incubation period of <i>S. recurrentis</i> varies from two to
twelve days, during which time a very slight indisposition may be
noticed. The onset is usually sudden, with severe headache, pains
in the back, limbs and stomach and a feeling of weakness. There
is a rise of temperature to 103Â°&nbsp;F. or 104Â°&nbsp;F., and the temperature
continues high till about the sixth or seventh day. The skin is
yellowish, hot and damp; a rash, disappearing on pressure, may occur
on the trunk and legs, nausea is always present and thirst is usual.
The liver and spleen both enlarge. The number of respirations and
pulse-rate become increased. On the sixth or seventh day a crisis
occurs. There is violent perspiration, with a rapid fall of temperature,
pulse and respiration become normal and the patient sleeps and
awakes better. Improvement continues for some days, and recovery
may ensue, but usually about the fourteenth day relapse occurs,
lasting usually three or four days. A second relapse is unusual.
Numerous complications are known, <i>e.g.</i>, bronchitis, pneumonia,
diarrhÅa and dysentery.</p>

<p>With regard to treatment, the specific appears to be salvarsan.
Castellani and Chalmers recommend salvarsan administered intravenously.
Intramuscular inoculations (for example, into the buttock)
of a suspension of â606â in oil can also be given. The drug is very
efficacious, but large doses should not be given. An intravenous
injection of 4 or 5&nbsp;gr. does not give rise to unpleasant symptoms
but is sufficient to effect a cure.</p>

<p>The incubation period for the American form of the disease is at
least five to seven days, and the first attack lasts about five to six days.
The treatment is by salvarsan as detailed previously.</p>

<p>As relapsing fever is spread by body lice and possibly by bugs,
preventive measures are directed against these insects. Strict
cleanliness of person, clothing, bedding and dwellings is essential.
Furniture, <i>e.g.</i>, wooden bedsteads, liable to harbour such insects
should not be used.</p>

<p>The principal and best-known relapsing fever of Africa is that
excited by <i>SpirochÃ¦ta duttoni</i>, and transmitted to man by ticks, chiefly
<i>Ornithodorus moubata</i>. The incubation period is usually about
seven days but may be longer. The patient is dull and lethargic,
perspires freely and is often constipated. The temperature rises to
103Â°&nbsp;F. or 105Â°&nbsp;F., there is headache, pains in the back and limbs,
general chilliness and great pain in the region of the spleen, which
often enlarges. The symptoms become worse, there is a fall of
temperature with improvement in the morning, and a rise, with
increase of pain, in the evening. SpirochÃ¦tes are now found in<span class="pagenum" title="631"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631"></a></span>
the blood in greater numbers. The symptoms last three to four days
and end in a crisis with profuse sweating and fall of temperature
below normal. The day before the crisis there is a pseudo-crisis,
when the temperature falls but there is no improvement. The
patient is left weak and tired. Recovery may follow, but more usually
a relapse occurs. The intermission period varies; five to eight days
is common. The symptoms of the relapses are like those of the first
attack. The number of relapses varies, five to eleven may occur.</p>

<p>The treatment recommended is by salvarsan, as for the European
relapsing fever.</p>

<p>With regard to prophylaxis, localities where ticks abound must
be avoided and the parasites themselves destroyed. Native huts
should be avoided. Mosquito nets, a bed well off the ground and
the use of night lights are advised by Manson to avoid attacks by
ticks, which are often nocturnal in their habits.</p>

<p>In North Africa (Algeria, Tunis, Tripoli, Egypt), and sometimes
in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, a spirochÃ¦tosis due to <i>S. berbera</i>
occurs. According to Castellani and Chalmers, the incubation period
varies somewhat. The fever reaches its height during the first twenty-four
hours, and afterwards shows a morning remission. Jaundice
is often absent, but there may be hepatic tenderness and splenic
enlargement. One or two relapses usually occur. The treatment is
on the same lines as for the other spirochÃ¦tal fevers. Sergent and
Gillot<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> (1911), working at the Institut Pasteur of Algeria, have had
good results by using injections of salvarsan in doses of 0Â·75 to
1Â·0 cg. per kilogramme weight of the patient. The prophylactic
measures are directed against lice and other biting insects. Personal
cleanliness is most necessary.</p>

<p>In Asia, a relapsing fever, due to the spirochÃ¦te named <i>S. carteri</i>
by Manson in 1907, producing a mortality of about 18 per cent.,
occurs. The symptoms have a general resemblance to those produced
by <i>S. recurrentis</i>, but on the fall of temperature to subnormal on the
sixth or seventh day, when profuse perspiration and polyuria occur,
instead of improvement following, the patient often becomes collapsed,
with a clammy skin and feeble pulse. Improvement is slow. The
first relapse occurs about the fourteenth day of the attack, when the
temperature may be higher than for the first attack. There are
seldom more than four relapses. The treatment is by salvarsan, of
which doses of not more than 5&nbsp;gr. intravenously should be given.
Sudden heart failure being common, Castellani and Chalmers state
that cardiac stimulants should be given. Prophylaxis is the same as
for European relapsing fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="632"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632"></a></span></p>


<p class="ph1">B.&emsp;<b>Yaws or FrambÅsia tropica.</b></p>

<p>Yaws is essentially a tropical disease, though it is found in the
tropical and subtropical zones in all parts of the world, except in the
mountains and cold districts. In 1905, Castellani found the causal
organism, <i>Treponema pertenue</i> (sometimes called <i>SpirochÃ¦ta pertennis</i>)
(see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_127">127</a>). The disease shows three periods: (1) The primary stage,
consisting of the development of the primary lesion or papule, which
is usually extragenital. The papule dries into a crust beneath which
an ulcer lies. (2) The secondary or granulomatous stage, which commences
from one to three months after the primary lesion is first seen.
It consists of a general eruption of small papules, some of which enlarge
and become granulomatous nodules covered with a yellowish crust.
They are common on the limbs and face. (3) The tertiary stage, in
which deep ulcerations and gummatous nodules appear. Any of the
tissues may be involved. Osseous lesions may occur. The disease
does not appear to be hereditary; it is usually spread by contact.</p>

<p>The best treatment appears to be by salvarsan or neo-salvarsan.
Castellani and Chalmers recommend intramuscular and intravenous
injections. For intramuscular injection an alkaline or neutral solution
of the drug is preferable, or a suspension of the drug in oil
may be used. The dose varies from 0Â·3 to 0Â·5&nbsp;gr according to
the age and sex of the patient. For use intravenously, a slightly
smaller dose is required. Galyl is also being used.</p>

<p>In countries where frambÅsia is endemic, slight skin abrasions
should be carefully treated with antiseptics. Yaws patients should be
isolated till cured, and their dwellings and personal possessions
disinfected.</p>


<p class="ph1">C.&emsp;<b>Syphilis.</b></p>

<p>Syphilis, due to <i>Treponema pallidum</i> (sometimes called <i>SpirochÃ¦ta
pallida</i>), is prevalent throughout the tropics as well as in temperate
zones. The disease is amenable to treatment by salvarsan and neo-salvarsan,
for administration of which see relapsing fever and yaws.
Galyl is also being used with favourable results. Lambkinâs mercury
cream has been found useful in treating numerous cases in Uganda.
The life-history of the parasite is given on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_124">124</a>, and further medical
details hardly come within the purview of this book.</p>


<p class="ph1">D.&emsp;<b>Bronchial SpirochÃ¦tosis.</b></p>

<p>Bronchial spirochÃ¦tosis, due to <i>SpirochÃ¦ta bronchialis</i> (see
pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_122">122</a>, <a href="#Page_739">739</a>) is probably of wide distribution in the tropics. The
spirochÃ¦tes have been found in cases of chest complaints, especially
those with bronchitic symptoms. The disease may be suspected in
atypical cases of pneumonia and bronchitis, and may be mistaken for
incipient phthisis.</p>

<p>Chalmers and OâFarrell<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> (1913), writing from Khartoum, recommended

used in West Africa.</p>


<h5>VI.&mdash;MALARIA.</h5>

<p>Malaria, known also under the names of ague, paludism, marsh
fever, remittent fever, intermittent fever and climatic fever, among
others, is a very widely spread disease. It is most prevalent in the
equatorial regions and gradually diminishes north and south of the
equator. The various malarial parasites (see pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_155">155</a> to <a href="#Page_172">172</a>) are spread
by species of Anophelines, and hence malaria is present in districts
favourable to these intermediate hosts, that is, in places where there
is a considerable amount of atmospheric moisture and rain, as well
as heat.</p>

<p>The principal malarial parasites are: <i>Plasmodium vivax</i>, the agent
of simple tertian fever; <i>Plasmodium malariÃ¦</i>, the parasite of quartan
malaria, and <i>Laverania malariÃ¦</i> or <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, producing
malignant tertian or sub-tertian malaria (and quotidian, see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_167">167</a>).
These various malarial fevers present certain clinical features in
common, which will be stated here (see also pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_155">155</a> to 157).
For further particulars regarding malaria in all its aspects the reader
is referred to the book by Sir Ronald Ross on âThe Prevention of
Malaria,â to the âManual of Tropical Medicine,â by Drs. Castellani
and Chalmers, and to the âTropical Diseasesâ of Sir Patrick Manson.</p>

<p>Typical malarial fevers consist of a series of pyrexial attacks which
recur at definite intervals of twenty-four (quotidian), forty-eight or
seventy-two hours, according to the parasite present in the patientâs
blood. Each attack shows three stages, a stage of rigor, a heat stage
and a stage of profuse perspiration. Following on these three stages,
there is an interval relatively or actually without pyrexia. Then the
fever returns again. A rise of temperature, often accompanied by a
general feeling of malaise, may precede the initial stage of rigor. When
the latter sets in, the patient feels intensely cold, shivers violently, the
skin becomes cold and the features pinched. There may be violent<span class="pagenum" title="634"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634"></a></span>
vomiting and convulsive attacks in young children. The temperature,
however, is really above the normal, and continues to rise. After
about an hour, the shivering abates and the heat stage succeeds it.
The temperature rises rapidly, even to 106Â°&nbsp;F. The patient becomes
very flushed, the pulse is rapid, headache may be intense and the skin
dry and burning. This stage, that causes acute distress to the patient,
may last for one or often three to four hours, and then the patient
commences to perspire profusely, the clothing and bedding often
being saturated with sweat. After this, the fever rapidly declines, and
when the sweating ceases, the patient may feel almost well although
somewhat languid. The sweating stage persists from two to four
hours, so that the attack lasts as a rule from six to ten hours. After
an interval of one, two or three days, a recurrence takes place.
During the early part of the attack, especially at the stage of rigor,
there is great splenic enlargement. At first the enlargement disappears
in the interval, but in the case of repeated attacks the spleen tends to
become permanently enlarged. During malarial attacks and during
the intermission period, there is a great increase in the amount of
nitrogen excreted by the kidneys, while the excretion of iron and bile
in the fÃ¦ces is increased.</p>

<p>Stitt<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> (1914) points out that it is characteristic of malignant tertian
paroxysms that they set in with chilly sensations rather than a frank,
definite chill, and that the fever is of the remittent type.</p>

<p><i>Plasmodium malariÃ¦</i> and <i>P. vivax</i> rarely produce marked lesions
in the bodies of their hosts, as they sporulate in the circulating blood
and so do not accumulate in any one organ. On the other hand,
<i>Laverania malariÃ¦</i> (<i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>) multiplies within the
internal organs of its host, and consequently aggregates or clusters
of the parasites occur therein. The organ in which most sporulation
occurs suffers most. The liver is generally enlarged, soft and congested.
The capsule of the spleen is tense, but the splenic consistency
is less than normal. The bone-marrow is often dark and congested
in the spongy bones and brownish-red in long bones. The blood-capillaries
of the brain and spinal cord are often filled or blocked
with sporulating parasites and large quantities of pigment are found
in these organs. Even if the parasites are absent, the pigment is
present in the endothelial cells. Pigment is found in most organs of
the body.</p>

<p>Atypical forms of malaria may occur in which some or all of
the symptoms are much modified. Irregular fevers also may be
produced by successive infections by the same parasite, or by the
presence of two different malarial parasites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="635"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635"></a></span></p>

<p>As regards the diagnosis of malaria, according to Manson the
three pathognomonic signs are&mdash;periodicity, the effect of quinine, and
the presence of the malarial parasite.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;The great specific for malaria is quinine. It attacks
the merozoites or asexual generation. The drug can be administered
by the mouth, by the rectum, by intramuscular injections or
by intravenous injections, the two latter methods being adopted in
serious infections or where gastric complications are present. When
quinine is taken by the mouth, the more soluble acid salts, <i>e.g.</i>,
quinine bihydrochloride and bisulphate, are better than the sulphate,
the form in which quinine is usually sold. Tablets, pills and capsules
are convenient means of taking quinine but must not be old
or hard, or they may pass unchanged through the body. In the
case of mild tertian or quartan malaria, Castellani and Chalmers
recommend the administration of a dose of quinine four hours
before the sporulation of the parasite is due. Another modification
is to give 10&nbsp;gr. of quinine by the mouth in the morning and a second
dose of 10&nbsp;gr. as above. In many cases they give 5 to 10&nbsp;gr.
of the drug three times a day. Administration of quinine <i>per
rectum</i> may be useful but they recommend intramuscular inoculation.
The solutions used must be sterile, and the âsterilettes,â
small, hermetically sealed vials, containing 1&nbsp;grm.) or <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&nbsp;grm.
(<span class="nowrap">7â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&nbsp;grm.) of quinine in solution, are recommended. A deep injection
into the deltoid or gluteus muscle is usual.</p>

<p>For pernicious infections, intravenous inoculation with not less
than 1&nbsp;grm. at a time is recommended.</p>

<p>After the fever has subsided, the administration of quinine in
smaller doses must be continued for some time, in order to avoid
relapses.</p>

<p>Stitt (1914) writes that âthere now seems to be a tendency to use
the alkaloid itself instead of its salts, it having been found that the
alkaloid and its very insoluble tannate are absorbed from the digestive
tract equally as well as the soluble salts.â Euquinine or ethylcarbonate
of quinine contains 81 per cent. of quinine, but is expensive.</p>

<p>During malarial attacks, constipation must not be allowed.
Headache can be relieved by cold applications, and perspiration must
be encouraged in the early stage by hot tea, warm lime drinks, etc.
After bad attacks, a change to a cooler climate is desirable, but the
quinine treatment must not be discontinued.</p>

<p>Preventive measures take two main forms, directed respectively
against the malarial parasites in man, and against the mosquitoes
that convey the parasite from man to man.</p>

<p>With regard to man, houses should be built away from low-lying
marshy ground, and kept free from vegetation such as grass or<span class="pagenum" title="636"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636"></a></span>
brush which furnishes shelter to the mosquitoes. In the tropics, the
chief reservoirs of the malarial parasites are the native children, hence
European quarters should be away from native dwellings as far as
possible. Mosquito nets, having twenty to twenty-four meshes per
square inch, should be used invariably, and houses should be screened.
Malaria-conveying mosquitoes bite chiefly towards evening. Quinine
treatment for preventive purposes is important. A dose of 5&nbsp;gr. of
quinine daily, with a dose of 10&nbsp;gr. on the seventh day (Castellani), is
efficacious. Some workers, however, recommend a large dose (15&nbsp;gr.)
on two consecutive days every eight or ten days for three months,
while others recommend 10&nbsp;gr. twice a week. Celli administered 3&nbsp;gr.
of quinine morning and evening.</p>

<p>The second line of attack is directed against mosquitoes, especially
Anophelines, on the lines so well set forth by Sir Ronald Ross.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> The
accumulation of small quantities of water in various vessels, many of
them unnecessary, should be prevented, as <i>Stegomyia</i> (Culicines) breed
in such receptacles. Anophelines breed in small pools. All drinking
water and household vessels, water-butts and cisterns must be
effectively screened with wire gauze. Cesspools, etc., must also be
screened, and they, and all collections of water, should be oiled with
crude petroleum sprays every week or ten days, or fortnight according
to some workers. The petroleum is a good larvicide and suffocates
the Anopheline larvÃ¦, while its presence renders the site obnoxious
to the adult mosquitoes. The amount of crude petroleum or kerosene
will vary according to the locality concerned, due regard being paid
to its powers of spreading on the surface treated. Different authorities
have used different quantities, such as 1&nbsp;oz. of oil to 1 square yard
or to 15 square feet. Others have used 1 pint of the petroleum to
a circle of 20 feet in diameter, while <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> pint for every 100 square feet
of surface has also been recommended. The larvicide used so
successfully in Panama consisted <span class="nowrap">of:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>One part of this mixture in 5,000 parts of water containing
mosquito larvÃ¦ destroys them within five minutes; 1 part in 8,000
of water kills larvÃ¦ in thirty minutes. Small fish, such as the
âmillionsâ fish, that feed on the larvÃ¦, can be introduced into
collections of water and are of local service. Ducks may also act as
destroyers of larvÃ¦. The growth of water-weeds and rank vegetation,
that affords shelter to the larvae, must be prevented as far as possible.</p>

<p>Wherever possible hollows should be filled up, swamps and roads<span class="pagenum" title="637"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637"></a></span>
should be well drained. Much good has followed the use of such
measures in Panama, Egypt, British Guiana and other places. The
ideal conditions for malaria reduction appear to consist in a combination
of general quinine prophylaxis with anti-mosquito measures.</p>


<h5>VII.&mdash;BALANTIDIAN DYSENTERY.</h5>

<p>This disease is also known as ciliate or ciliary dysentery. The
chief causal agent is <i>Balantidium coli</i>. Others are <i>Balantidium
minutum</i>, <i>Nyctotherus faba</i>, etc. (see pp.&nbsp;200â206).</p>

<p>Balantidiasis is insidious and is marked by alternate attacks of
diarrhÅa and constipation with vomiting, while mucus is passed in
the motions, which are foul smelling. There may be chronic ulceration
of the colon. Ådema of the face and limbs and anÃ¦mia may
occur.</p>

<p>Treatment is at present rather unsatisfactory. Castellani and
Chalmers state that âthe symptomatic treatment for entamÅbic
dysentery may be tried.â Various treatments, more or less empirical,
by calomel, quinine, carbolic acid in pill form, salicylic acid,
extract of male fern, methylene blue, iodine solution, rice water and
tannin enemata are mentioned by Prowazek<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> (1913) and by Seifert.
E.&nbsp;L. Walker<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> (1913) found, from experimental work, that organic
compounds of silver, <i>e.g.</i>, protargol, were most effective. Local treatment
by large enemata of collargol or protargol seems to be indicated.
Behrenroth<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> (1913) successfully treated a Prussian case with thymol,
given in 4&nbsp;grm. doses every two days, followed at the end of a
fortnight by de-emetinized ipecacuanha, given in pills containing
6 cg. each, to the number of thirty a day. In about another fortnight
the symptoms had subsided. The thymol checked the
diarrhÅa, but it was necessary to give the de-emetinized ipecacuanha
to kill off the balantidia still present. Phillips (1915) also recommends
thymol. Ardin-Delteil, Raynaud, Coudray and Derrieu (1914)
found neither emetine hydrochloride nor protargol of use.</p>

<p>As regards prophylaxis Walker states that pigs âshould be
confined and not allowed to run in yards and dwellings.â Behrenroth
considers that dirty hands, for example, those of farm workers
brought into contact with pigs, are probably the medium of infection.
The personal cleanliness of such persons is, then, of the
greatest importance.</p>

<h5>FASCIOLIASIS.</h5>

<p class="tac"><b>Fasciola hepatica.</b></p>

<p>The symptoms of disease evoked by <i>Fasciola hepatica</i> are rarely
observed in our part of the world, whereas Kermogant<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> states them
to be of frequent occurrence in Tonkin<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a>; the parasites are there
called âDouves.â In our experience they are only accidentally
found <i>post mortem</i> in a certain number of cases, as no changes are
manifested during life which would permit of any conclusion being
drawn as to the presence of these parasites. In three cases (Bierner,<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a>
Bostroem<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> and Sagarra<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a>) icterus was present; in a fourth case, recorded
by Duffek,<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> the parasites had led to a severe and acute distomiasis of
the liver, combined with chronic purulent and ulcerative cholecystitis,
with purulent cholangitis and dilation of the bile-ducts and numerous
small abscesses of the liver. The total number of flukes found in
these cases amounted to about fifty. The parasites passed from the
duodenum into the bile-ducts, and first obstructed the flow of bile
and then set up icterus, followed by cholecystitis and cholangitis.</p>

<p>As regards localization of the liver fluke in the pharynx, see p.&nbsp;242.</p>

<p>The treatment must be directed to the principal symptoms;
prophylaxis is especially important in districts where distomiasis is
of frequent occurrence. As the embryos live in water, only boiled
or filtered water should be drunk. The attempts of Tappeiner<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> to
discover an effective remedy against liver-fluke disease (liver rot), so
prevalent among sheep, were unsuccessful.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Fasciolopsis buski.</b></p>

<p>This parasite lives in the intestine, not in the liver of man; it
produces bloody stools and typical symptoms&mdash;high fever and a
condition of apathy (Odhner).<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="639"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639"></a></span></p>

<h5>PARAGONIMIASIS.</h5>

<p class="tac"><b>Paragonimus ringeri.</b></p>

<p>The disease produced by the lung fluke is specially endemic in
Japan, also in isolated parts of China, Formosa and Korea. The
fact that the lung-fluke disease is most frequently found in mountainous
districts (Katsurada<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a>) is worthy of special attention. The onset
of pulmonary paragonimiasis is generally insidious (Looss<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a>); generally
the only symptom is a slight cough, occurring at first at longer, and
later at shorter intervals; it is accompanied by the expectoration of
discoloured sputum, frequently blood-stained. Though now and
then severe hÃ¦morrhages result, up to the present no case has been
established in which they have been the direct cause of death.</p>

<p>Examination of the thorax frequently fails to reveal anything
abnormal. Inouye<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> states that the most frequently observed changes
consist in retraction of the thorax and in a contraction of its infrascapular
portion. Scheube<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> repeatedly observed that the one side,
presumably that which harboured the worm, moved less freely than
the other. The physical changes are not uniformly spread over the
whole lung, but are localized. The disease may come to a standstill
for long intervals and then set in again, lasting on the whole from ten
to twenty years. In addition to paragonimiasis of the lungs, cysts are
frequently found on the eyelids, which occasionally extend deeply into
the orbit and hinder the movements of the eyes. <i>Post mortem</i>, cysts
the size of hazel nuts containing one, two, or three adult worms
are found in the lungs, and in addition, not uncommonly there exist
pulmonary emphysema and bronchiectasis. Besides being present in
the lungs and in the eyelids, the parasites have also been found in the
pleura, the liver, the intestinal wall, the peritoneum, the cervical
glands, and in the scrotum, without actually occasioning any actual
symptoms in these tracts.</p>

<p>The most dangerous locality is in the brain. Otani,<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> Inouye,<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a>
Yamagiva,<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> and recently also Taniguchi,<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> have found <i>post mortem</i>
the worms and their ova in tumours of the brain, or, in areas of
softening in cases of Jacksonian epilepsy; in Taniguchiâs case the
eggs were found in masses in the inflammatory areas of softening.
In the nineteen cases of paragonimiasis of the brain collected by
Inouye, the following symptoms were observed: general convulsions
on eight occasions, unilateral convulsions on six occasions, convulsions
with paralysis on the same side and hemiplegia, five times each;
<span class="pagenum" title="640"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640"></a></span>in Taniguchiâs case, attacks of cortical epilepsy, choreiform twitchings
in the right extremities, which gradually become athetotic. The
following were symptoms of rarer occurrence: paresis of the right
upper extremity, vertigo, dementia, and amnesic aphasia, disturbances
of vision. Paragonimiasis of the brain appears to arise by
embolism from a primary pulmonary lesion.</p>

<p>The diagnosis depends upon the finding of ova in the sputa; if
together with ova in the sputa, cerebral disturbances make their
appearance, in all probability the cause is the presence of worms or
ova in the brain.</p>

<p>The prognosis of pulmonary paragonimiasis is favourable; on
the other hand, that of cerebral paragonimiasis is very doubtful.</p>

<p>The treatment of the pulmonary lesion consists only in paying
attention to the general condition (good food, rest, cough remedies),
as all attempts to destroy the worms in the lungs by means of vermicidal
drugs administered internally or by way of inhalation have so
far been without result. The treatment of the cerebral lesion is
entirely hopeless. Trephining has been proposed for cases the condition
of which is more favourable, but it has not reached the stage
of performance.</p>

<p>Prophylaxis consists in general management: cleansing and if
need be boiling of everything that is eaten or drunk.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Clonorchis sinensis.</b></p>

<p>According to our present knowledge <i>Clonorchis sinensis</i> is only
found in China and Japan; even the <i>post-mortem</i> case reported by
Laspeyres<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> was that of an Asiatic sailor who was admitted into the
General Hospital St. George, Hamburg, in a moribund condition
with the clinical diagnosis of beri-beri. The bile-ducts are the usual
site of the parasite, though Katsurada<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> has found them also in the
pancreatic ducts. In addition, it is found not uncommonly in the
upper portion of the small intestine, especially in the duodenum,
also, though decidedly rarely, in the stomach. As these sites, however,
do not afford the conditions necessary to life, they are only found
here on their way out of the body of the host.</p>

<p>The initial stage of infection with this fluke generally runs a
symptomless course; in proportion as the worms multiply the
following symptoms are manifested: First there is a morbid sense of
hunger and irregularity in defÃ¦cation; at the same time the patient
experiences a feeling of pressure and pain in the epigastrium and right
hypochondrium, or just a dull pain. Pressure increases the pain
considerably. The liver appears to be enlarged, sometimes the<span class="pagenum" title="641"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641"></a></span>
enlargement is specially perceptible over the left lobe of the liver.
The patients maintain a proportionately good general state of health in
this state for a long time and may hope to recover. In severe cases
there occurs copious and generally bloody diarrhÅa, also icterus.
The next stages are anÃ¦mia, emaciation, epistaxis, ascites, enlarged
spleen, and cachexia, to which the patient finally succumbs. In
general the course of the disease is very chronic and irregular; in
winter and spring there is generally improvement, in the summer and
autumn the patient gets worse. At <i>post-mortem</i> the bile-ducts are
enlarged and thickened, there is interstitial hepatitis with enlargement
of the liver, but not to such an extent as in hypertrophic cirrhosis.
After the initial enlargement contraction of the liver sets in, the
peritoneal coat and capsule proper of the liver become more or less
thickened in places. In the pancreas also dilatation and thickening
of the ducts occur, as well as interstitial inflammatory processes.
Obstructions in the portal circulation may lead to catarrhal changes
in the stomach.</p>

<p>The diagnosis is based on the demonstration of ova in the fÃ¦ces.</p>

<p>As a radical treatment is still unknown, consequently it can only be
purely symptomatic. Prophylaxis consists in the prohibition of
drinking unboiled water or eating uncooked molluscs, fish, etc., of
canal water. Leaving the epidemic region may bring about gradual
recovery.</p>


<h5>BILHARZIASIS.</h5>

<p class="tac"><b>Schistosoma hÃ¦matobium.</b></p>

<p>The symptoms of bilharziasis are manifested chiefly in the urinary
apparatus, and above all as hÃ¦maturia, at the outset without any
special troubles. Later, however, it is accompanied by subjective
symptoms in the shape of feelings of pain, and of vague pains in the
perinÃ¦um and lumbar region, and of burning in the urethra during
the passing of urine. All the symptoms are usually aggravated after
excesses in eating and drinking, and after considerable bodily exertion.
Another condition found, but not often mentioned, is lipuria (Stock<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a>);
the highest amount has been 2 per cent. fat in the urine. Stock found
6 to 20 per cent. of eosinophile cells in ten cases examined by him.
They appear to be increased, especially in the early cases; Kautsky<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a>
also called attention to the excessive degree of eosinophilia, whilst
Goebel<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> expresses the opinion that a specific toxic action on the
organism generally is not developed in bilharziasis. Kautsky<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> assumes
a toxic anÃ¦mia as in the case of ancylostomiasis. English authors
also have called attention to the eosinophilia and to a considerable<span class="pagenum" title="642"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642"></a></span>
amount of leucocytosis (Balfour,<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> Douglas and Hardy<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a>). The
severe forms occur almost exclusively in men; symptoms of catarrh
of the bladder make their appearance, vesical calculi are frequently
found, whilst the formation of stone in the kidneys and ureters is
rare. Urethral fistula occurs in bilharziasis, often without stricture,
and if granulations occur the fistula is distal to them. Goebel<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a>
regards the bilharzia fistula as a chronic burrowing of pus, caused by
the irritation set up by the ova as foreign bodies and consecutive
restricted suppuration; and secondly as due to the passage of urine
through the defect in the epithelium or the wall of the urethra. The
fistulÃ¦, which are generally situated at the neck of the bladder and at
the membranous portion, are very tortuous and frequently very
numerous; they often lie embedded in well-marked tumours&mdash;in fact,
in granulation tumours with marked inclination to excessive formation
of cicatricial tissue. The opening generally is in the perineal and
scrotal regions. In the case of a patient, aged 21, from the Transvaal,
Kutner<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> found by cystoscopic examinations the whole summit and
walls of the bladder covered with large and small tumours. In
addition to smooth glistening tumours, others were more or less disintegrated,
and scattered large and small cauliflower-like growths
occurred. Like malignant growths, the tumours were inclined to
break down, the process extending from within outwards towards the
surface. Whether the hydrocele so frequent in Egypt has any
connection with bilharzia is not known. A frequent sequela of
bilharziasis is complete sexual impotence (Petrie<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a>).</p>

<p>Bilharziasis of the rectum is manifested by symptoms of
dysentery; the repeated violent attempts at defÃ¦cation lead in time to
prolapse of the rectum, which sooner or later induces septic infection
and so death. In the mucosa of the rectum, polypoid growths similar
to those in the bladder are met with, due to the ova of the parasites
in the mucosa and submucosa. In the case of a man, aged 36, who
had lived for a long time in South Africa, Burfield<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> found in the
excised vermiform appendix ova of <i>Schistosoma hÃ¦matobium</i>; he
assumed this to be a gradual secondary infection of the appendix,
whilst Kelly<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> mentions a case of primary bilharziasis of the appendix;
the eggs lay in the submucosa directly above the muscularis.
Tumours containing numerous ova are frequently found in the region
of the genitalia, thighs and scrotum. In one case Symmers<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> found
numerous male schistosomes in the portal blood and a copulating<span class="pagenum" title="643"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643"></a></span>
pair in the left lung. Though schistosome eggs have been found by
some observers in the lung tissue, this is nevertheless the first case in
which living parasites have been found in the lesser circulation.
Perhaps they got there by way of the external iliac vein from the
veins of the bladder and rectum.</p>

<p>In the female sex bilharziasis is incomparably rarer than in the
male and is generally limited to hÃ¦maturia. Bilharziasis of the
vagina, which takes the form of an acute vaginitis, is frequent
according to Milton.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> Horwood<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> found in one case a polypoid
tumour of the cervix uteri, and in the connective tissue of the tumour
Schistosoma ova, both in masses and singly. It could not be
established whether the ova reached the vagina and thence the cervix
directly, or through the urine from the bladder.</p>

<p>The course of the disease is chronic, and in slight cases, provided
fresh infections do not occur, is not unfavourable; in severe cases
the cachexia caused by loss of blood, or intercurrent diseases to
which the patients easily succumb&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, pyelitis, pyelonephritis,
pyÃ¦mia, or urÃ¦mia&mdash;lead to a fatal issue.</p>

<p>In regions in which <i>Schistosoma hÃ¦matobium</i> is endemic, or in
patients from such regions, the diagnosis is easy by microscopically
finding the eggs in the urine.</p>

<p>As regards the treatment of the affection this much must be said,
that so far there is in existence no certain remedy. In countries
where bilharziasis is endemic copaiva balsam is considered a specific.
Kutner (<i>loc. cit.</i>), however, in the case of his patient who for a long
time had taken no inconsiderable amounts of copaiva, had no success
worth speaking of to record. Urotropin (three times daily, 1&nbsp;grm.)
has similarly failed, salol (0Â·75&nbsp;grm. several times daily) perhaps affords
relief in affection of the bladder (Milton). Methylene blue, oil of
turpentine with extract of male fern (Brock<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a>), or the latter alone and
santonin given in small doses for a week at a time, in the morning, are
said by Petrie<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> to be of value. Sandwith<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> and Harley<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> were not
very successful. By way of experiment Kutner for some time used
collargol <i>per rectum</i>, proceeding on the assumption that this preparation,
which has proved of such remarkable service in bacterial infection,
would perhaps render a continuance of life difficult for the
bilharzia worms. But this hope proved illusory. In order so far
as possible to limit the loss of blood, Kutner regularly employed
stypticin for long periods (three times daily, two tabloids of 0Â·<span class="pagenum" title="644"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644"></a></span>01&nbsp;grm.)
with undoubted success, in so far that the hÃ¦morrhages became
considerably less in amount. As two patients in the course of enteric
fever lost their hÃ¦maturia, Stock accordingly recommends subcutaneous
injections of Wrightâs typhoid vaccine. In the early stages
of the rectal lesion suppositories of iodoform, ichthyol, or narcotics
might possibly be of use. In the case of urethral fistulÃ¦, division,
excision and scraping out of the granulation tissue are recommended;
in cystitis with formation of tumours high resection with curetting
of the tumours or their destruction with the cautery; in the case of
vesical calculi, high resection, curetting the bladder, and then
drainage. Tumours of the rectum must also be removed by
operation.</p>

<p>Prophylaxis is important; it should be extended to all modes of
using water, only filtered water being drunk, and only boiled water
being used for washing. This advice should be given to tourists who
travel through the infected districts, and is also recommended to
soldiers and officials who are despatched to the Colonies. The favourable
influence of change of climate can only show itself where fresh
infections are avoided.</p>


<h5>CESTODES.</h5>

<p class="tac">GENERAL.</p>

<p>It seems advisable to preface the section on the Cestodes with
some general observations on the symptoms of disease provoked by
tapeworms, especially so far as they relate to the question of toxic
effects, and to include the Nematodes in this discussion. After this
will follow a brief exposition of the most important intestinal lesions
causally connected with intestinal parasites.</p>

<p>It is known to every experienced practitioner that the different
intestinal parasites can give rise to a series of nervous symptoms,
slight or severe, and produce, above all, blood changes&mdash;anÃ¦mia of
the most varied nature, to the extent of severe progressive anÃ¦mia.
These symptoms are regarded by many authors as reflex, or, as in
the case of ancylostomiasis, the main feature from the loss of blood
caused by the habit of life of the intestinal parasites. More frequently,
however, they are regarded as toxic conditions produced by
the parasites. In view of this divergence of opinion there appears
to be some advantage in defining clearly the present position as to
the toxic action of parasites. Most interesting in this respect are
<i>Dibothriocephalus latus</i> and <i>Ancylostoma duodenale</i>.</p>

<p>We are indebted to the clinic at Helsingfors for our most detailed
knowledge of bothriocephalus anÃ¦mia. Reyher<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> was the first to<span class="pagenum" title="645"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645"></a></span>
demonstrate that this parasite under certain circumstances can produce
a severe, progressive and sometimes fatal anÃ¦mia, which can be
cured, generally in a surprisingly short time, by expulsion of the
worm. Among the various hypotheses which have been advanced
as to the mode of origin of bothriocephalus anÃ¦mia, the greatest
importance has been attached to the assumption already mentioned
by Reyher, but definitely expressed by von Shapiro,<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> to the effect that
<i>Bothriocephalus latus</i> produces a poison which is absorbed by the
intestine and exercises a deleterious influence on the composition of
the blood, especially on the erythrocytes, perhaps also on the blood-forming
organs. This assumption is supported by no slight number
of clinical and experimental investigations. Podwissotsky<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> observed
severe blood changes in a child, aged <span class="nowrap">4â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2,</span></span></span> affected with <i>B. latus.</i> In
the case reported by Pariser<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> the severe anÃ¦mia in a girl disappeared
fairly soon after expulsion of the worm. In that reported
by Schaumann<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> high fever accompanied the bothriocephalus anÃ¦mia;
he also proved the hÃ¦molytic properties of the broad tapeworm.
The case reported by F. MÃ¼ller<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> was one of severe anÃ¦mia. Also, in
the first of the cases described by Kurimoto<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> of <i>Diplogonoporus
grandis</i> there were present the same symptoms of anÃ¦mia as in the
case of <i>B. latus</i>. Meyer<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> observed severe anÃ¦mia in two youths
caused by <i>B. latus</i>. Rosenquist<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> has discussed the proteid metabolism
in anÃ¦mia. The presence of <i>B. latus</i> produces in the majority of
cases an increased proteid consumption, to which the blood change
generally corresponds&mdash;toxic anÃ¦mia; in a further communication
he reports on twenty cases of bothriocephalus anÃ¦mia, nineteen of
which were cured by expulsion of the worms, while one case proved
fatal, and he again emphasizes the toxic properties of the intestinal
parasites. In the case reported by Bendix,<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> that of a girl, aged <span class="nowrap">4â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2,</span></span></span>
the anÃ¦mia was moderate, whilst in the case of Zinn<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> (a woman,
aged 30) the anÃ¦mia was so excessive that the patient succumbed
five days after expulsion of six bothriocephalus heads. Isaac and
van den Velden<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> have established that in the serum of patients who
suffer from anÃ¦mia due to <i>B. latus</i>, parasitic products are dissolved,<span class="pagenum" title="646"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646"></a></span>
as shown by a distinct precipitin reaction. Galli-Valerio<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> considers
it likely that toxic substances are secreted by the living helminthes
which produce a lowering or raising of the body temperature, nervous
disturbances and hÃ¦molysis. Tallqvist<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> succeeded in extracting
from <i>B. latus</i> a lipoid-like body which had a strong hÃ¦molytic action.
The experimental anÃ¦mia thereby produced differed in no respect
from the severe chronic bothriocephalus anÃ¦mia of man. The
question as to under what special conditions severe, and sometimes
fatal bothriocephalus anÃ¦mia is developed is answered by Leichtenstern<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a>
and by Lenhartz,<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> by the assumption that among the Bothriocephali
some are toxic, that is, manufacture a poison which, when
absorbed by the host, produces a severe anÃ¦mia.</p>

<p>Certain factors lead him to conclude that an accumulation of
poison, dependent on time and place, occurs in the Bothriocephali.</p>

<p>In the case of ancylostome anÃ¦mia, experience so far, according
to Leichtenstern,<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> by no means supports the hypothesis of a difference
in virulence of the worms according to time and locality, ancylostome
anÃ¦mia being rather, so far as is known at present, in all races of
man, everywhere and at all times, simply and solely dependent on
the number of ancylostomes, the duration of the disease and&mdash;within
certain narrow limits&mdash;on the individual capability of resisting
the loss of blood and the toxic effect of the parasites. As is shown
by a short historical rÃ©sumÃ© of the toxic action that has to be considered
in ancylostome anÃ¦mia, we must admit that doubtless here,
as in the case of bothriocephalus anÃ¦mia, the toxins secreted by the
parasites exercise a hÃ¦molytic action, even while admitting Leichtensternâs
contention that the significance of the loss of blood due to
ancylostomes must not be underrated. The toxic hypothesis acquired
a definite standing through a series of experiments of Lussana<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> on
rabbits, where he succeeded in producing anÃ¦mia by injecting urinary
extracts of ancylostome patients. Arslan<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> extracted toxins from the
urine of two ancylostome patients and injected them into rabbits,
which thereupon sickened and showed the same blood changes as
the ancylostome patients. Retinal hÃ¦morrhages, so frequent in
ancylostome anÃ¦mia, which, according to Fischer<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> and Samelsohn,<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a>
are not due to direct loss of blood, must also be ascribed to a parasitic
toxin. A further argument in favour of the toxic hypothesis<span class="pagenum" title="647"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647"></a></span>
is furnished by the blood changes recorded by Zappert,<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> MÃ¼ller and
Rieder,<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> BÃ¼cklers,<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> and Neusser,<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> which must be regarded as the
expression of toxic action, especially with reference to eosinophilia.
The striking increase in proteid destruction in ancylostomiasis
observed by Bohland,<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> and which ceased after the parasites had been
expelled, also gives additional support to the assumption of toxic
action. The observation of Daniels<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> also deserves consideration in
this connection, according to which the presence of yellow pigment
in the liver and kidney cells is to be attributed to blood destruction
by a verminous toxin absorbed from the gut. Looss<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a> considers it
not at all improbable&mdash;in fact, almost certain&mdash;that Ancylostoma, in
addition to withdrawing blood, exert a kind of toxic action on their
host.</p>

<p>Scheube<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> attributes almost equal importance to the loss of blood,
the digestive disturbances, and the intoxication induced by certain
metabolic products of the parasites. According to v. Jaksch<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> ancylostome
anÃ¦mia is not induced solely by loss of blood, but by the
fact that the parasites produce a ferment which has a toxic action
and produces stimulation in those organs in which the eosinophile
cells arise. The hÃ¦molytic action of ancylostomes has frequently
been observed by Galvagno<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> in men employed in sulphur mines.
According to Loeb and Smith<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a> the anterior half of the body of
ancylostomes contains a substance which probably causes anÃ¦mia.
Bauer<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> found in the urine of ancylostome patients glycuronic acid,
which he considers to be a sign of metabolic disturbance due to
parasitic toxins. As has been demonstrated by Allessandrini,<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> the
secretion of glands in the anterior part of the body has a distinct
hÃ¦molytic effect on the erythrocytes. While the worm attaches
itself to the mucosa by means of its teeth, these glands discharge
their secretion, producing hyperÃ¦mia. The extravasated blood is
acted on by this secretion, so that it can serve as food for the
parasites. Hynek<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> attributes eosinophilia (up to 20 per cent.) to
a toxic action. Goldmann<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> expresses a similar opinion, though he<span class="pagenum" title="648"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648"></a></span>
assumes that the anÃ¦mia is secondary, as the toxin of the cephalic
glands, as the parasites bite, penetrates the mucosa and thence into
the blood, where it dissolves the red blood corpuscles. Romani<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a>
discusses the agglutinating hÃ¦molytic action of the serum of ancylostome
patients. Whether Ancylostoma produce toxins and what
is their nature, or whether the loss of blood causes the anÃ¦mia,
Liefmann<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> was unable definitely to determine; hÃ¦molytic substances
do not appear to take any part in it.</p>

<p>Berti<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> also is inclined to attribute the anÃ¦mia to metabolic
products of the ancylostomes; he found, in fact, that a serum obtained
from a sheep (after subcutaneous injections of the culture fluid of
ancylostome larvÃ¦) was efficacious in the treatment of ancylostome
anÃ¦mia. Peiper<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> likewise assumes that the parasite secretes a cell
toxin. LÃ¶bker<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> at the present day still maintains that the cause of
the disease must be looked for really, if not perhaps entirely, in the
continued withdrawal of blood by the parasites; the secretion of
toxins by ancylostomes has not yet, in his opinion, been conclusively
proved. Except in the case of <i>Bothriocephalus latus</i>, referred to
previously, toxic action appears to be of quite subordinate importance
for the other Cestodes occurring in man&mdash;especially <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i> and
<i>T. saginata</i>, which are most frequently found; thus Cao<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> flatly denies
the presence of toxins in the body of TÃ¦niÃ¦, while others, such as
Messineo and Calmida,<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> Jammes and Mandoul,<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a> consider they are
justified from their investigations in concluding that TÃ¦niÃ¦ contain
a specific toxin. Messineo<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> injected, with all bacteriological precautions,
extracts of TÃ¦nia, dissolved in physiological salt solution.
He invariably obtained severe motor disturbances and frequently
death. The observation by Pereira<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> of a case of chorea in which
rheumatic and cardiac symptoms were absent and which after expulsion
of a TÃ¦nia was quickly cured, also favours the view of a toxic
action. Barnabo,<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> however, was unable to obtain a toxin from <i>TÃ¦nia
saginata</i>. Gagnoni,<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> on account of a marked eosinophilia which,
after expulsion of a <i>TÃ¦nia saginata</i>, fell within fourteen days to
1 per cent., assumes the formation of a TÃ¦nia toxin. Dirksenâs<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a>
observation has reference to a sailor affected with serious anÃ¦mia,
who, after expulsion of twelve pieces of <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i>, was rapidly<span class="pagenum" title="649"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649"></a></span>
cured. A portion of the worm was already breaking down, the
absorption introducing into the body highly toxic hÃ¦molytic products,
to which the anÃ¦mia must be ascribed. How far the serious
disturbances of the nervous system, frequently to be observed in
cases of <i>Hymenolepis nana</i>, are to be considered as of purely reflex
nature or toxic must remain an open question; the same applies to
<i>Dipylidium caninum</i>, in which case Brandt<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> observed serious central
nervous symptoms. Caution is necessary in judging as to any connection
between worm stimulus and nervous symptoms in cases of
Ascaris infection. Peiper<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> is inclined to regard such nervous
symptoms not as reflex, but rather as due to a toxin contained in
the helminthes, or metabolic in origin.</p>

<p>In cases of pernicious anÃ¦mia when the symptoms disappear after
expulsion of <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> a toxic action must be assumed (Demme<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a>).
Additional clinical observations do not, indeed, lead to any definite
conclusion as to the question whether <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> produce a toxin which
is capable of causing more or less injury either to the nervous system
or to the blood, yet it may be worth while to give a brief review
of this question. In a case of Kutnerâs,<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> that of a girl, aged 12,
there was a hÃ¦molysis which was cured after expulsion of twenty-four
<i>AscaridÃ¦</i>. Attacks of opisthotonos in a girl, aged 16, ceased
after seventy-eight <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> had been expelled (Lutz<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a>). Unusually
serious disturbances were observed in a man, aged 26, who was rapidly
cured by Drouillard<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> by the removal of a great number of <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>.
The observations on pseudomeningitis are of especial interest; they
are evidently toxic in origin as in the case of Annaratone,<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> of a man
who was taken ill with gastro-intestinal symptoms and who died with
meningitic symptoms. <i>Post mortem</i> the brain was normal, but the
stomach contained a great coil of <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>. The cases of Delille,<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a>
MÃ©riel,<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> Papi<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> (the occurrence of Cheyne-Stokes respiration has been
ascribed to the action upon the centre in the medulla oblongata of
the products of the <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>), and Taillens<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> related to children in
which the meningitic symptoms (meningismus), partly serious, disappeared
with the removal of the <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>. MÃ¡reo<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> designates this
disease helminthiasis meningitiformis, which exhibits all the symptoms<span class="pagenum" title="650"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650"></a></span>
of meningitis, but which is caused by the metabolic products of
<i>AscaridÃ¦</i>.</p>

<p>Schupfer,<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> Duprey<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> (observations in the West Indies, where such
symptoms are said to be of very frequent occurrence), Naab<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> (the flow
of water from the mouth at night is mentioned as a remarkable fact),
and Hammiss<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> assume the action of an Ascaris toxin in the clinical
observations made by them, mostly children with fever and intestinal
symptoms. Schupfer assumes in such cases, as he observed it once
in a man, aged 23, that the disease termed <i>Lombricoise Ã  forme typhoÃ¯de</i>
by Chauffard was due to <i>B. coli</i> of marked virulence due to the
action of the <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>. The Widal reaction was negative. Koneff<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a>
reports a case in which acute attacks of cramp, trismus, and rigidity
of the pupil disappeared after expulsion of seven <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>. Tetanus,
as observed by Buchholz<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> in a girl, aged 17, and rapidly cured after
expulsion of sixteen <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>, is manifestly rare, since only Rose<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a>
mentions this as a cause in his article on Tetanus. Only a few
experimental data exist. Cattaneo<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> could detect only a very weak
toxin in Ascaris, while Messineo,<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> by injecting into animals extracts
in physiological salt solution, invariably succeeded in producing serious
motor disturbances and frequently death. Interesting also are the
observations of Huber,<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a> who, after working with <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>, suffered
from itching of the head and neck, blisters, swelling of the ear, conjunctivitis,
ecchymosis and troublesome palpitation in the head. He
consequently assumes that <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> can induce irritation by chemical
(toxic) means.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>Trichocephalus dispar</i> no more than in the case of
<i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> can we speak with certainty of a toxic effect, even
though a number of observations are available which might justify
such an assumption as regards these intestinal parasites. Barth<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> found
the brain normal in a man who had died with meningitic symptoms,
but the intestines were full of <i>Trichocephalus dispar</i>; Gibson<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> records
the rapid cure of serious cerebral symptoms after expulsion of Trichocephalus,
so also Pascal,<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> Burchhardt<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> and Rippe.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> Moosbrugger<span class="pagenum" title="651"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651"></a></span><a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a>
was the first to draw attention to grave anÃ¦mic conditions induced by
Trichocephalus, Morsasca<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> and Becker<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> to progressive grave anÃ¦mia
(trichocephalus anÃ¦mia is accompanied by marked reduction of the
number of red blood corpuscles, of the specific gravity and of the
hÃ¦moglobin, well-marked morphological changes of the red cell,
micro-, macro-, and poikilocytosis and nucleated red cells). Sandler,<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a>
in his case of a boy, aged 11, who died of anÃ¦mia, assumes a trichocephalus
toxin to be the cause of the disease, and Kahane also reports
on anÃ¦mic conditions induced by Trichocephalus. Girard,<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> in addition
to symptoms in the gastro-intestinal tract, calls attention to those
arising in the blood&mdash;anÃ¦mia and its sequelÃ¦&mdash;and also to nervous
symptoms: cerebral phenomena, headache, giddiness, aphonia, symptoms
of meningitis. In a case of Schillerâs<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> high fever was present,
which probably set in when the Trichocephali present in the gut in
great numbers commenced their parasitic activity. Hausmann,<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> in
order to explain the adaptability of Trichocephalus, assumes that
according to the <i>locus minoris resistentiÃ¦</i>, at one time the reflex at
another the toxic action is effective, now on one organ, then on
another; anÃ¦mia being present in most cases, frequently general
and local neuroses and cerebral symptoms of various kinds.</p>

<p>With regard to the toxic action of Oxyuris there is only the single
record of Hartmann,<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> who noticed the disappearance of epileptic
fits and psychic disturbances in a girl, aged 13, after the removal of
Oxyuris. Nervous disturbances and blood changes can but rarely be
attributed to Strongyloides. Silvester<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> and Valdes<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> report on giddiness,
headache and anuria in cases observed by them; whether the
eosinophilia recorded by BÃ¼cklers<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> and Bruns<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> is due to the toxin
of Strongyloides must remain an open question.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the possibility that intestinal
ciliates (<i>Balantidium coli</i>) can also produce toxins.</p>

<p>The contents of echinococcus cysts appear to contain a substance
only moderately toxic, giving rise to urticaria, in a series of cases
where the fluid has escaped into the abdominal cavity (during
puncture). D. MÃ¼ller<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> has collected nine such cases out of the
literature, to which may be added six cases of Finsen<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> in which the<span class="pagenum" title="652"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652"></a></span>
escape of fluid into the peritoneal cavity led to severely itching
urticaria, which usually disappeared again after one or two days.
On one occasion, indeed, urticaria occurred after rupture into the
pleural cavity. In the case recorded by Caffarena<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> of echinococcus
of the right lobe of the liver, widespread urticaria developed as the
result of the exploratory puncture. In the case of an echinococcus
of the liver rupturing into the abdominal cavity La Spada<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> ascribed
the symptoms leading to death to toxic influence while the peritoneal
symptoms were less marked. Eosinophilia in hydatid disease is slight
according to the investigations of Bindi<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a> and Santucci,<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> and is,
according to Welsh and Barling,<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a> no certain sign of echinococcus;
it is independent of the age, sex and temperature of the patient, but
upon rupture of the cyst eosinophilia invariably sets in.</p>

<p>The question as to the importance of helminthes in relation to
certain diseases of the gut requires special discussion, but it concerns
only <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>, <i>Oxyuris vermicularis</i>, and <i>Trichocephalus
dispar</i>, and the question of appendicitis first of all. The entrance of
intestinal parasites into the vermiform appendix was already known
to medical men in the fifties of last century, as is shown by the works
of Merling<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> (1836), Zebert<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> (1859), Platonor<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> (1853), and Schachtinger<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a>
(1861). Most of these authors have considered intestinal worms,
together with other foreign bodies, to be the cause of appendicitis.
As regards the part played by these intestinal parasites in the etiology
of appendicitis, so much discussion has taken place during the last
few years that it is worth while to give a rÃ©sumÃ© of the later views on
this question, even though at the outset it must be admitted that the
matter is not cleared up. Bergmann<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> records a case in which an
Ascaris perforated the appendix and got into the peritoneal cavity.</p>

<p>StrÃ¼mpell<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> reckons among the symptoms of Trichocephalus the
possibility of a âtyphlitis.â On account of the marked sensitiveness
of the ileo-cÃ¦cal region, Boas<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> mentions the possibility of confusing
it with appendicitis. Still<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> regards Oxyuris as a principal cause of
catarrhal affections of the appendix. ArborÃ©-Rally<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> regarded severe
symptoms of appendicitis in a boy, aged 10, as due to Ascarides.
In all cases of appendicitis Metschnikoff<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> requires a microscopical
examination to be made for eggs, and considers treatment for worms<span class="pagenum" title="653"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653"></a></span>
carried out otherwise as a cause of the frequency of perityphlitis.
Matignon<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a> does not agree with this opinion, as in spite of the extraordinary
frequency of intestinal worms in China, he has only seen
one case of appendicitis in four and a half years, and Des Barres<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a>
expresses himself in similar fashion. Out of twenty-one cases of
appendicitis Kirmisson<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> discovered the ova of Trichocephalus eighteen
times and the ova of Ascarides in three of these cases; in twelve cases
of enteric fever the examination for eggs was negative nine times.
Moty<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> considers Oxyuris to be the sole cause in his three cases of
appendicitis. Girard<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> ascribes to Trichocephali the <i>rÃ´le</i> of more
or less septic foreign bodies which may bring about the entry of
intestinal bacteria into the appendix, and Triboulet<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> describes a
case of appendicitis which he considers was due to Ascaris. In
Morkowitinâs<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> case numerous Oxyuris had clearly caused the
appendicitis. von Genser<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> records the case of a boy, aged 5, who
was operated on for appendicitis, and who passed through the operation
wound a living Ascaris on the eighteenth day after the operation.
In the first case communicated by Schiller<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> the disappearance of the
typhlitic swelling after the discharge of the Ascarides pointed to the
etiological significance of the parasites, and the same obtained in a
further case published at an earlier date by Czerny and HeddÃ¤us.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a>
In a case abstracted by Kaposi<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> Trichocephali appear to have been
a contributory cause in the production of the appendicitis. In a
further case reported by Schiller, where the appendix was removed,
it was shown that Oxyuris had given rise to a pronounced appendicular
colic. In a girl, aged 13, who died from diffuse peritonitis,
Schwankhaus<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> found that an Ascaris had perforated the appendix.
Ramstedt<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> found in an extirpated appendix a whole âtangleâ of
Oxyuris, and believes in the possibility of their having provoked the
inflammation; he recommends an examination for entozoa before
the operation, without, however, after Metschnikoffâs example, substituting
worm treatment for the operation. Rostowzeff<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> ascribes
only a minimal direct etiological significance to intestinal worms<span class="pagenum" title="654"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654"></a></span>
in the origin of appendicitis; in 163 cases he found worms in three
instances. Wirsaladze<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> expresses himself in a similar fashion.
Oppe<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> observed Oxyuris six times in excised appendices, and
emphasizes the opinion that in appendicitis the question of a worm
cure ought to be taken into consideration. Ascaris and Oxyuris, if
no contra-indication exists, may be expelled, but in the case of
Trichocephalus, which frequently defies all expulsive treatment, no
attempt should be made, but operation proceeded to forthwith.
In a case briefly reported by Hanau<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> Oxyuris was undoubtedly the
etiological starting-point; in a case of Galli-Vallerio<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> Oxyuris and
Trichocephalus. In the opinion of Ssaweljews<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> in some cases of
appendicitis, in addition to other causes, intestinal parasites play a
prominent part. The case recorded by Nason<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> is an interesting one;
in this an Ascaris in the appendix became twisted with it round a coil
of gut, causing obstruction. Spieler<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> argues against the underestimation
by many authors as to the part played by intestinal worms
in producing appendicitis, although he also does not regard them
as a frequent, to say nothing of an exclusive, cause of the disease.
In a case recorded by BÃ©gonin<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a> fifteen Oxyuris were found in the
excised appendix (the mucosa showed some ulceration), and in another
recorded by Putnam<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> twenty Oxyuris were present in the appendix,
in which there was no evidence of any change. The standpoint
Schilling<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> takes is to the effect that entozoa irritate the mucosa and
can increase an already existing inflammation, but he considers it
very questionable whether they can produce appendicitis. Blanchard<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a>
assumes the possibility of a secondary infection arising from lesions
of the mucosa produced by helminthes (Ascaris and Oxyuris).
Moore<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> considers Trichocephalus the excitant of the appendicitis
in his case. In a second case of appendicitis recorded by Auley<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a>
operation became unnecessary owing to the passage of the <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>.
Pageâs<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> case is an interesting one; it was that of a man who came
up for operation with a diagnosis of appendicitis. On incising the
abdominal wall numerous Ascarides were found at the base of the<span class="pagenum" title="655"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655"></a></span>
wound, lying in cavities; even after eight days Ascarides escaped
from the wound. The author assumes there was a perforation of the
gut wall; it is strange that the worms were able to exist a proportionately
long time in the muscular tissue. Schoeppler<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> states that there
is the danger of an appendicitis even after the death of an Oxyuris
that has found its way into the appendix. Oui<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> met with two
specimens of Trichocephalus which had become embedded by their
thin ends deep in the mucosa. Frangenheim<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> is not in a position to
pronounce any opinion as to what part intestinal parasites play in the
etiology of appendicitis. In a case recorded by Kahane<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a> many
Trichocephali were found partly free in the appendix and partly
embedded in the mucosa; microscopically appendicitis was diagnosed.
At a laparotomy for salpingitis Heekes<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a> found the appendix
elongated, thickened, and containing about eleven Oxyuris without
the mucosa being in any way changed. In one case Andrews<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> claims
Ascarides to have been the direct cause of the appendicitis. The
literature dealing with this question, so important in our time, has
been collected almost without any omissions, but, unfortunately,
no decisive opinion as to the significance of parasites in appendicitis
can be inferred from it. The vexed question whether intestinal
parasites, especially Ascaris, are able to penetrate the intestinal wall is
just as little finally decided. Leuckart,<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> Heller,<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> Mosler and Peiper,<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a>
Henoch,<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> Davaine,<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> KÃ¼chenmeister,<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> and Bremser<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> are opposed
to the idea that the healthy intestinal wall can be penetrated by
intestinal worms, especially Ascarides, whilst a whole series of other
authors are of the opinion that even the healthy intestinal mucosa can
be perforated. Among these is numbered MondiÃ¨re,<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> who is of the
opinion that Ascaris, by violent pressure against the mucosa, forces it
so much apart that it is enabled to escape through the gap thus
formed into the peritoneal cavity; this opinion is shared by
v. Siebold.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> Rokitansky<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> considers perforation of the gut by Ascaris<span class="pagenum" title="656"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656"></a></span>
as at least a rare occurrence. Gerhardt<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a> does not doubt that the
worms can actively perforate the intestine. Cases like those of
Abrault,<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> Apostolides,<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> Marcus<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> (recorded by Perls as a valid
example of âascaridophagousâ gut perforation), Wischnewsky,<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a>
Galvagno,<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a> Salieri<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> certainly show that perforation of the healthy
gut wall cannot be denied, but at the same time that this occurrence,
compared with the frequency of <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>, should be regarded as
exceedingly rare. It is another matter as to whether it is possible
for the worms to penetrate an intestinal wall already diseased,
especially when ulcerated; a whole series of observations are in
favour of this. In Liniâs<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> case (fifty-six Ascarides escaped from the
umbilicus of a girl, aged 7), in GrÃ¤ffeâs<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a> (eighty Ascarides escaped
from an inguinal tumour), in Nicolinoâs<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> (perforation of the intestinal
wall with strangulated hernia), in Liesenâs<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> (a living Ascaris in the
peritoneal cavity in a woman suffering from a peritoneal abscess)&mdash;in
these it is clear that disease processes in the intestine preceded the
exit of the worms. In a case described by Boloff<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> the Ascarides
appear to have produced, by forming a tight coil, necrosis of the
gut with perforative peritonitis. In a case recorded by Lutz<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> the
perforative peritonitis was without doubt provoked by Ascaris, and
in one by Schiller<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> the Ascaris had clearly gained access to the
peritoneal cavity through a gunshot wound opening. In a case
observed by Rehn<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> the worm probably entered through a gangrenous
portion of the intestine in a hernial sac. Broca<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a> is unable to determine
whether in his case the intestinal perforation was primary
(a worm escaped from the abdominal wound about two months after
a laparotomy for suppurative peritonitis). The case reported by
Lutz<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a> is of special interest: it was that of a young man who had
shot himself in the region of the abdomen, and who died after fifteen
days. At the <i>post-mortem</i> two Ascarides were found in the pulmonary
artery; they had probably escaped from the intestine, and had gained
access to the inferior vena cava. Froelich<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a> assumes that in his case<span class="pagenum" title="657"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657"></a></span>
(a boy, aged 11) the Oxyuris were able to penetrate the whole
intestinal wall, but Vuillemin<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> considers this improbable, and is
more inclined to think that the Oxyurides penetrated the rectum at
small ulcerated points, and thus gained access to the perirectal
connective tissue. In females Oxyuris not only have the power
of penetrating far into the sexual organs (Marro<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a>), and perhaps causing
a parasitic endometritis (Simons<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a>), but also clearly of gaining access
to the peritoneal cavity by way of the tubes, as is to be assumed in
the case recorded by Kolb<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> (that of a woman, aged 42, in whom <i>post
mortem</i> nodules were found over the peritoneum of Douglasâs pouch,
in which the pressure of encapsuled Oxyuris could be demonstrated),
in that reported by Chiari<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> (adult Oxyuris in Douglasâs pouch) and
by Schneider<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> (an Oxyuris encapsuled in the pelvic peritoneum).
Sehrtâs<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a> case is worthy of attention; in this an abscess was found in
the omentum with numerous Ascaris ova in the pus and a <i>nodular</i>
lesion of the peritoneum, with Ascaris ova encapsuled in the nodules.
Massive accumulation of Ascarides may give rise to a complete
occlusion of the gut. Such an occurrence is not so surprising as
might be thought when one reflects that the number of Ascarides in
one individual may amount to several hundreds. For instance, one
boy evacuated within a single day 600 Ascarides (Fauconneau-Dufresne<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a>)
and within three years 5,126 worms. In the case
recorded by Tschernomikow<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a> a boy, aged <span class="nowrap">2â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2,</span></span></span> evacuated during a
day 208 worms, partly through the stomach, partly through the
intestine. Coil-formation of such masses of Ascarides renders
possible not only constipation, but also complete obstruction with
symptoms of ileus, as shown by the five cases quoted by Mosler
and Peiper,<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> as well as from observations made by Raie,<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> Schulhof,<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a>
Rehberg,<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> Rocheblave,<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> Heller,<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a> Leichtenstern,<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> Huber,<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> and
Wilms.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> In two cases of Black<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> and Parkinson<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a> the intestinal
obstruction was caused by a coil of tapeworms.</p>

<p>In the earlier history of medicine the helminthes played a great
part as the excitants of many intestinal diseases and of enteric
as well. Even if to-day they no longer be regarded as such, the
conception that they represent the predisposing factor in typhoid<span class="pagenum" title="658"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658"></a></span>
infection through the injury they inflict on the mucosa (Guiart,<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a>
Blanchard,<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> Vivaldi and Tonello<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a>) must not be summarily rejected.
Vivaldi and Tonello found helminthes in 80 per cent. of their
typhoid patients, numbering among these <i>Trichocephalus dispar</i>,
<i>Oxyuris vermicularis</i>, <i>Ancylostoma duodenale</i>, and <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>. The
report of Leuckart<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a> is here worth citing, to the effect that Thiebault
never failed to find Trichocephalus in his cholera patients at Naples.
Blanchard<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> goes so far as to express the desire that in every febrile
affection of the intestine an anthelmintic treatment with thymol
should be undertaken as early as possible, even before learning the
results of serum diagnosis.</p>

<p>The lesions of the liver and pancreas due to <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> are briefly
discussed in the chapter on Ascariasis (p.&nbsp;687).</p>

<p>A discussion of the intestinal helminthes from the clinical and
therapeutical point of view follows these general considerations.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Dibothriocephalus latus.</b></p>

<p>From what is known as to the development of <i>Dibothriocephalus
latus</i>, the way by which man is infected is self-evident: infection
can only take place through the ingestion of insufficiently cooked
fresh-water fish (pike, burbot, perch, grayling and vendace); what
degree of temperature is necessary to kill the larval forms is still
unknown. <i>Dibothriocephalus latus</i> lives in the small intestine of man,
alone or in some numbers, frequently also together with <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i>.
The proglottides are passed always united in large pieces, the ova are
deposited through the uterine pore, while the worm is still in the
intestine, so that they are easily found in the fÃ¦ces. The proglottides
are so characteristic that they cannot be confused with those of other
species. In reference to whether age or sex is spared by <i>D. latus</i>,
it is not possible to make any definite statement, especially so far
as the endemic area is concerned, whether a person resides in it
continuously or visits it, so long as his habit of life is in accordance
with those of the country. Bendix<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> certainly emphasizes the fact
that early childhood is as a rule immune: his case was that of
a child, aged <span class="nowrap">4â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="659"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659"></a></span></p>

<p class="ph1"><b>Sparganum mansoni.</b></p>

<p>According to our present knowledge (Miyake<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a>) the disease occurs
almost exclusively in China and Japan. On the main island it occurs in
all districts, though rarely under observation. It is especially frequent
in the neighbourhood of Kioto and Osaka; these places are very
near together, and between them there is mutually active intercourse,
so that taken together they may be regarded as one district infested
by this worm disease. As regards localization in the body, there
appears to exist a certain predisposition for definite regions, for
instance, the eye and genito-urinary tract. In some cases the parasite
manifested the peculiarity of wandering about the body and of
appearing at certain favourite points (musc. quadriceps femoris)
(Hashimoto<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a>). Most patients complain more or less of the onset of
attacks of pain and of sensitiveness to pressure. In those cases in
which the patients evacuated the worm during micturition, the
symptoms were variable; sometimes there was tenesmus of the
bladder, sometimes pains in the inguinal region, sometimes
hÃ¦maturia. None of these troubles is characteristic of the disease,
and does no more than represent the symptoms that follow a
mechanical irritation that any kind of foreign body may produce.
Besides the onset of attacks of pain, swelling of the regions affected,
if superficial, may often be recognized, when a superficial diffuse
soft tumour can be felt which often gives pseudo-fluctuation. Sometimes
a peculiar crackling can be detected internally, as in the making
of a snowball. During the further course an abscess not infrequently
forms around the worm. When the situation of the worm is superficial,
âan inflammatory tumour with a tendency to migrateâ is
stated by Omi<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> to be an important diagnostic sign. That, however,
is not always the case, as the observation made by Inoye<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a> shows. It
would be better to add to this sign the onset of paroxysmal pain and
the temporary change in volume of the tumour. When once the
parasite is removed, the wound heals just as satisfactorily as any
other fresh wounds made at operation.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Dipylidium caninum</b> (<i>TÃ¦nia cucumerina</i>).</p>

<p>This species belongs to parasites of rare occurrence. Up to the
year 1905 Bollinger<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> collected thirty-six cases from the literature,
twenty-nine of which were children and seven adults. Since then<span class="pagenum" title="660"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660"></a></span>
some further cases have come to light, so that the number now
observed amounts to ninety, and among them only eight adults.
The youngest child was 6 weeks old (KÃ¶hl<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a>), in which the first proglottides
were passed when the child was 40 days old. This preponderating
occurrence in children is clearly connected with the
close intercourse between children and dogs, and also cats. Bollinger
believes that <i>D. caninum</i> in reality occurs more frequently in adults
than has hitherto been supposed. In addition, it must be mentioned
that this species is quite unknown to many physicians, and is
occasionally confused with <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i>. One notices almost daily
a large quantity of cucumber-seed-like bodies, reddish or whitish-grey,
about 1&nbsp;cm. long and 2&nbsp;mm. broad, discharged with the stools.
Lindblad<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> remarks that these bodies have lively movements, that they
perish rapidly in fresh water, and become white and smooth. These
Cestodes, in isolated cases, are parasitic in the intestine in large
numbers. Sonnenschein<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> expelled four fragments in the case of a
boy, aged 4 months; Asam<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> three fragments in the case of a child, aged
19 months; and Zschokke<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> as many as five or six in that of a boy,
aged 4. They do not always produce such striking symptoms as
occurred in Pollakâs case.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> In other cases gastro-intestinal disturbances
with or without fever (KrÃ¼ger<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a>), emaciation (Zschokke),
or even nervous symptoms of central origin in the form of convulsions
(Brandt<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a>) have been observed. From the nature and mode
of infection children must be kept from close contact with dogs and
cats as much as possible to ensure prophylaxis. The appropriate
treatment, as it mainly affects children, deserves special mention,
whilst the expulsion of the remaining Cestodes may be described in
this connection. Among the drugs one may mention flor. kousso
1Â·0&nbsp;grm., pulpa tamar. depur. 2&nbsp;grm., syrup of sugar 50Â·0&nbsp;grm., one-third
to be taken every hour (Lindblad). Kamala appears to have no
effect, although Huber<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> recommends it in small doses according to
age from 0Â·5 to 3Â·0&nbsp;grm. He warns against <i>Filix mas</i> preparations,
which otherwise, even in early childhood, under careful dosage gives the
best results. Young children are given 1Â·0 to 2Â·0&nbsp;grm. extr. fil. maris,
with mint syrup or raspberry syrup 30Â·0&nbsp;grm., in the morning twice an
hour by the mouth, or 1Â·0&nbsp;grm. extr. fil. maris is mixed with syrup<span class="pagenum" title="661"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661"></a></span>
of mint, and given by means of a stomach tube (Rosenberg<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a>). A few
hours afterwards a mild laxative may be taken&mdash;one to two tablespoonfuls
of aqueous tincture of rhubarb (Asam)&mdash;or an enema may
be given. In a case reported by Sonnenschein decoction of pomegranate
root had no effect, as it was vomited up.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Hymenolepis nana.</b></p>

<p>This species, very rare in Central and Northern Europe, inhabits
the small intestine, especially of children; it burrows very deeply into
the mucosa. Not uncommonly several thousand have been found in
one case (Nicolo,<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> E. Stoerk and Haendel<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a>). It is remarkable that
these Cestodes have been found so frequently <i>post mortem</i> and after
vermifuges given for other reasons. Thus the clinical symptoms
must often be very indefinite (Stoerk and Haendel), so that one
may assume that only a slight percentage of cases of <i>Hymenolepis
nana</i> come under observation and are published as such. On the
other hand, it is certainly conceivable that with the large number of
parasites that frequently occur in one individual a whole series of
symptoms, in part quite severe, are capable of being produced.
These are partly symptoms of intestinal catarrh, consisting of
abdominal pains, constipation, alternating with attacks of diarrhÅa,
perverse appetite, and boulimia, abdominal pains of a cramp-like
nature, followed by emaciation, headache, sleeplessness, pallor,
lassitude, and in part nervous symptoms&mdash;epileptiform attacks
without loss of consciousness, weakness of memory, melancholia,
irregular febrile attacks (Lutz<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a>). Possibly, too, <i>Hymenolepis nana</i>
infects the urinary organs, producing true chyluria (Predtetschensky<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a>).
Stoerk and Haendel are inclined to think that this species, unlike
other Cestodes parasitic in man and domestic animals, needs no
intermediate host for its development, and that the larval forms
(cysticercoid) live in the same host as the adults. The diagnosis
is based on the demonstration of ova in the stools. As far as
expulsion of this Cestode is concerned, santonin, kamala, kousso
flowers and thymol appear to have no effect of importance; whilst
extract of male fern, recommended by Grassi<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> as a result of his
considerable and successful experience, has been given, with the
result that the worms really are expelled, and that after the treatment
neither worms nor ova are any longer demonstrable in the stools of
patients. In his cases of chyluria Predtetschensky prescribed ol.<span class="pagenum" title="662"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662"></a></span>
terebinth. 20 drops three times daily for a fortnight, then acid. gallic.
0Â·5&nbsp;grm. three times a day for two days, then 1Â·0&nbsp;grm. three times a
day; the urine became clear, but whether permanent cure resulted
remained doubtful.</p>

<p><i>Hymenolepis diminuta</i>, <i>H. lanceolata</i>, <i>Davainea asiatica</i>, and <i>D.
madagascarensis</i> possess no actual clinical interest; with regard to
the latter it need only be pointed out that Bordier<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a> in studying a
case of chyluria found this species in the kidneys of a person in
Madagascar.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>TÃ¦nia solium.</b></p>

<p><i>TÃ¦nia solium</i> inhabits the small intestine of man; single
proglottides or whole worms may get into the abdominal cavity and
the bladder through fistulÃ¦, and penetrating the abdominal wall
escape outwards or become discharged with the urine. Symptoms of
intestinal stenosis are certainly very rare, as in the case recorded by
Steinhaus<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> of a child, aged 9, the stenosis ceasing after the expulsion
of the segments. The usual position of the worm in the small
intestine is with the head closely adherent to the mucosa and the
proglottides lying along the intestine; from time to time portions are
discharged with the fÃ¦ces <i>per rectum</i>. Its position can also be
reversed, and the proglottides in the gut become thus discharged by
vomiting.</p>

<p>The diagnosis depends upon the proglottides being generally
discharged in pieces in the stools, or eventually an examination for
eggs. Larval infection (<i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i>) occurs also in man
through auto-infection or through food.</p>

<p><i>Cysticercus cellulosÃ¦</i> of the skin and subcutaneous tissue occurs
very seldom singly; as a rule they are found in hundreds and
thousands in the same individual. They occur in different parts of
the body, especially on the flexor surfaces of the extremities (generally
symmetrically), small globular swellings, the size of a pea or a hazel
nut, smooth, of a tough cartilaginous consistence, fairly movable
under the skin, in the muscles less so. They never degenerate or
cause the surrounding skin to lose its colour. It is an interesting
fact that in the case described by Posselt<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> nodules on the face,
namely in the neighbourhood of the left cheek and behind the left
ear, reformed. The following are, according to Posselt, characteristic
for cutaneous tumours due to cysticerci: (1) the position in the
subcutaneous connective tissue (and almost always simultaneously
in the muscles); (2) the approximately equal size and regularly<span class="pagenum" title="663"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663"></a></span>
rounded oval form; (3) the peculiar density, almost reminding one
of cartilage in its hardness and the sensation of tightly distended
thick-walled bladders; (4) proportionately slight mobility; (5) with
painlessness, absence of any cutaneous reaction (hyperÃ¦mia or
swelling of the skin or pigmentation). The very gradual appearance
generally of the tumours supports the diagnosis, and in
addition to this evidence we may emphasize the preponderating
liability of the upper part of the body to attack and the symmetrical
arrangement of the nodules. Cutaneous and muscular cysticerci
cause the most varied symptoms, sensory disturbances, abnormal
sensations, depression and a feeling of weariness whenever the diseased
parts are moved, weakness in the lower extremities, pains in the course
of the sciatic nerve, in addition to those which simulate cramp in the
calves, numbness in the hands, pains upon their being moved. In
the case of a cysticercus situated in the elbow-joint, painful dragging
sensation in the course of the ulnar nerve persisted. In other cases
the arm was almost paralysed, or it could not be completely extended;
stiffness and bending of the little finger were noticed. Cysticerci of
the gluteal muscle cause trouble upon sitting and upon defÃ¦cation.
Remittent unilateral headaches were present in the case of a cysticercus
of the region of the right eyebrow; pains of a neuralgic
character radiated from the diseased temporal region. The cysts may
be inflamed and may suppurate; this especially happens in the case
of solitary cutaneous and muscle cysticerci. The best treatment
consists in puncture of the cysts with a Pravaz syringe and subsequent
injection of a drop of 1 per cent. sublimate solution. Tincture of
iodine has similarly been proposed (Wolff<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a>). Frangenheim<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> recommends
early extirpation (this, however, only in the case of
solitary cysts). Pelagutti<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a> believes that in his case diminution in
the size of the cysts was obtained by the use of anthelminthic remedies
continued over a long period combined with potassium iodide and
calcium salts (internally). Cysticercus is very rarely found in the
tongue; there the worms generally lie in front of the sulcus terminalis,
corresponding to the middle of the tongue, according to Glas.<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> In
the case recorded by Gaetano<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> (a boy, aged 10) there was a nodule
on the left side of the tongue which grew very rapidly till it reached
the size of a nut; it was embedded in the muscle and covered over
by normal mucosa. Cysticerci are just as rare in the pleurÃ¦, in the
lungs, in the intestinal submucosa, in the submucosa of the small<span class="pagenum" title="664"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664"></a></span>
intestine, in the mesenteric glands, in the liver, pancreas, spleen and
kidneys, in the mamma, in the heart, in the bones and in the great
vessels (Huber<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a>). Cysticercus of the eye deserves special mention;
in rare cases the cysticercus has been met with in the subcutaneous
cellular tissue of the eyelid, once in the muscle bundles of the
musculus orbicularis. Subconjunctival cysts are found chiefly in
youthful individuals. Their position is most varied, generally in the
neighbourhood of the inner angle of the eye. Dilated vessels pass
right over the cysts, which are generally movable, together with the base
they rest upon, producing a spherical protrusion. The head of the
worm can sometimes be seen shining through as a whitish speck.
The only symptoms are those of a slight irritation of the connective
tissue and some difficulty in closing the lid; larger cysts dislocate the
globe. The diagnosis has the rapid growth of the cystic tumour to
support it; there is the possibility of its being mistaken for a foreign
body (Kaldrovils<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a>). After division of the connective tissue capsule
extraction is easily performed. It is most rare for the cysticercus to
occur in the orbit. Suppuration of the cyst may have serious consequences
for the eye. It is only exceptionally that the cysticerci
gain access to the anterior chamber of the eye.</p>

<p>Subretinal cysticerci or those localized in the vitreous are more
frequent. Upon examination with the ophthalmoscope there is seen
in the vitreous a bluish bladder with a smooth surface. The head is
seen as a white patch, and the circle of hooks and the suckers
also come into view, also the frequent movements which the head
and neck make in the vitreous. Operation generally yields good
results; in rare instances the globe is atrophied and must be
enucleated.</p>

<p>Formerly cysticerci in the brain were met with in fair frequency,
but the number of such cases has generally decreased of late years in
a remarkable way, in correspondence with the diminution of cysticerci,
which is to be attributed to compulsory meat inspection. Whilst,
for example, the <i>post-mortem</i> records of the Pathological Institute in
Berlin before the year 1875 showed 20 per cent. cysticerci affecting
the brain, this number declined later to 16Â·3 per cent., and of late
years has fallen to 1 per cent. (Orth<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a>). Nevertheless even now
cysticercus still plays no inconsiderable part in the etiology of
cerebral diseases. For example, in the clinic of de Amicis at Naples,
among seven cases of cysticerci of the skin, they were found four
times also in the brain (Sipari<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a>). Cysticerci may occur in the dura
mater, arachnoid, pia mater, choroid plexus, the surface of the cerebral<span class="pagenum" title="665"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665"></a></span>
hemisphere, the medullary substance, the ventricles, the aqueduct,
the corpus striatum, corpora quadrigemina, the pineal gland, the pons,
the cerebellum, the olfactory trigone, the bulb, the medulla oblongata,
and the olive. They are most frequently found in the cortical substance
and in the ventricles; the frequency of the latter situation may
be explained by the flow of the fluid (Henneberg<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a>). The severity of
the symptoms is not always in proportion to the number of cysticerci.
Cases have been known in which ten, twenty and forty cysticerci have
been found (Hagen-Thorn<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a>), and yet the clinical symptoms have
been remarkably slight. On the other hand, solitary cysts may
both run a course completely without symptoms and also cause the
severest symptoms when located in specially important parts of
the brain (crus, pons, central convolutions). In the case mentioned
by Jacobson<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a> the invasion of the brain by cysticerci was immense;
the largest cyst was found in the cerebral cortex. The chief
symptoms of cysticercus of the brain substance consist in the
onset of cortical epilepsy, which sometimes runs a very pernicious
course, frequently with psychical disturbances, whilst paralyses are
absent. Perhaps, too, the localization of pain, spontaneous and on
pressure, corresponding with the points observed on the cranium,
is of importance. Cysticerci may also change their position
in the brain; patients who had earlier suffered from epileptiform
convulsions later showed intra-ocular cysticerci after the cerebral
symptoms had completely disappeared. Treatment can only be
surgical; v. Bergmann<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a> operated in two cases with well-marked
improvement. Parasites in the ventricles are especially dangerous,
more especially so when free in the ventricles, and so capable of
giving rise to the danger of sudden closure of the foramen of Majendie
(Simmonds,<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> VersÃ©<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a>). Stern<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a> states the symptoms of cysticercus
in the fourth ventricle to be the following: general cerebral pressure
symptoms (headache, vertigo, vomiting, somnolence, congested disc
caused by internal hydrocephalus); in addition, there are symptoms
which point to disease of the hind-brain&mdash;pain and stiffness in the
neck, vertigo and cerebellar ataxy, violent and persistent vomiting,
slowness of pulse; and lastly those rare but certain symptoms of a
lesion of the bulb, such as diabetes, respiratory disturbances and
paralysis of cerebral nerves, especially of the abducens. These are
far less marked than the general symptoms of cerebral pressure. One
characteristic is the remarkable alternation between severe general<span class="pagenum" title="666"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666"></a></span>
symptoms and periods of complete sense of well-being; in this way
a functional nervous affection may be simulated (Jolasse<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a>). Brunâs
symptom (in the widest sense, sudden onset of violent cerebral
symptoms upon change of head-posture) is a specially characteristic
sign of free cysticercus in the fourth ventricle; the disease generally
terminates with sudden death from cessation of the heartâs action.
Defects in motor power, convulsions, implication of other nerves,
are rare and unessential complications (Hartmann<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a>). Carefully
carried out, lumbar puncture may possess some diagnostic and
therapeutic value. Treatment is purely symptomatic, or eventually
Neisserâs ventricle puncture may be considered.</p>

<p>At the base of the brain the cysticerci, as a rule, assume that
form which is designated as <i>C. racemosus</i>, and consists of rows of
delicate grape-like bladders in groups, sometimes also markedly
branched, but generally sterile, which develop in the meshes of the
soft meninges and may envelop the nerves and vessels of the base of
the brain. Such tumours bring about hydrocephalus and chronic
leptomeningitis, which must be regarded as the causes of the clinical
disturbances (cysticercus meningitis), attacks of loss of consciousness,
dementia and apathy, dulness and confusion and headaches.
In the case recorded by Meyer<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a> symptoms which resembled paralysis
agitans were noteworthy, and defects in speech in the case recorded
by Durst<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> (<i>C. racemosus</i> in the region of the left Sylvian fossa).
According to Markwald<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a> <i>C. racemosus</i> of the fourth ventricle is said
to represent a characteristic clinical picture: violent headaches,
attacks of vertigo followed very soon by deep coma and death
in a few days. Treatment in <i>Cysticercus racemosus</i> is ineffectual.
In the diagnosis of cerebral cysticerci in general the recognition of
multiple cysticerci in the skin and muscle and of the tapeworm is
of importance. In cases of cerebral diseases in which cysticerci may
be a possible cause, Remmert<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> recommends that the skin of the
whole body should be palpated.</p>

<p>Cysticercus in the spinal cord and in the vertebral column is
occasionally observed; as a rule, other organs, above all the brain
and its membranes, are simultaneously affected. Here, too, the
cysticercus occurs in two forms&mdash;sometimes the cysts are roundish
or oval, solitary or multiple, and at other times <i>Cysticercus racemosus</i>
occurs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="667"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667"></a></span></p>


<p class="ph1"><b>TÃ¦nia saginata.</b></p>

<p>Occurs in the small intestine of man. It is characteristic of the
habit of life of this parasite that once it has become mature its
proglottides are dropped off daily in increasing numbers because
its growth is extraordinarily rapid. The joints are discharged
generally spontaneously during the whole day without a stool. An
extraordinarily unpleasant sensation is produced by the damp, cool
joints slipping down into oneâs lower garments and over oneâs legs
when walking; women especially, in whom the proglottides slip
through their petticoats on to their legs, complain bitterly of this
troublesome symptom. Another unpleasant symptom is superadded
in the shape of the proglottides tickling the rectum, and this excites
irritable people to the last degree. Different species of tapeworms are
not mutually exclusive. <i>B. latus</i> and <i>T. solium</i> frequently occur side
by side, so also <i>T. solium</i> and <i>T. saginata</i>&mdash;for instance, in a butcherâs
assistant we once expelled twelve <i>T. solium</i> and one <i>T. saginata</i> at
the same time. The greatest number of TÃ¦niÃ¦ which have been
observed at one time amounted to forty <i>T. solium</i> (Kleefeld<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a>).
Even though the cysticercus of <i>T. saginata</i> is not, as in the case of
<i>T. solium</i>, particularly dangerous to man, a parasite, nevertheless,
which requires so much nutrient material during its rapid growth,
and thereby sets up manifold disturbances in the general condition
of health, ought to be expelled as rapidly and thoroughly as possible.</p>

<p>Tapeworms are found not uncommonly with other intestinal
parasites, such as Ascaris, Oxyuris, Trichocephalus or Ancylostoma.
Prunac<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a> described a case in which a woman passed a TÃ¦nia through
the anus while she vomited a <i>Fasciola hepatica</i>.</p>

<p>The symptomatology of these three large species of Cestodes,
<i>Dibothriocephalus latus</i>, <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i>, and <i>T. saginata</i>, may very well
be summarized together, as, apart from some peculiarities, the clinical
symptoms, especially so far as their localization in the intestine is
concerned, are practically the same for all three species. In a large
number of cases the hosts have no suspicion whatever that they are
harbouring a tapeworm; they feel quite well and free from any
disquieting symptoms whatever, and only become aware of the fact
that they are the carriers of a tapeworm when the discharge of the
segments takes place; on the other hand, it is often difficult to rid
people of the idea that they are harbouring a TÃ¦nia (KÃ¼chenmeister
calls such <i>TÃ¦nia imaginata</i>); usually it is undigested fibrous shreds
of beefsteak which are regarded by the patients as proglottides of
tÃ¦niÃ¦.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="668"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668"></a></span></p>

<p>In a large number of cases, disturbances of the intestinal tract
set in, <i>e.g.</i>, sense of pressure in the abdomen, which sometimes
becomes constant on one and the same side, or sometimes
changes, now at the umbilicus and again at the epigastrium; here
and there colicky pains are present. Derangements of appetite and
digestion are frequently complained of; the most frequent are the
sensations of morbid hunger or irregular appetite, nausea and
vomiting. Thus, at the Third Congress of Internal Medicine,
Senator recorded a case in which there were symptoms of nervous
dyspepsia, cured after a successful vermifuge. There is either
constipation or diarrhÅa, so that many of such patients are brought
for treatment with the diagnosis of âchronic intestinal catarrhâ and
correspondingly treated. As to the treatment of toxic action of the
TÃ¦niÃ¦ when such arises, <i>see</i> the special section on the subject
(bothriocephalus anÃ¦mia, p.&nbsp;644). The frequent disturbances of the
general condition, so-called reflex phenomena, so far as the action of
toxic substances is not in question, may be explained by the fact of
their occurrence in specially sensitive individuals who are affected by
such phenomena. The proof that a diseased condition is produced
by a tapeworm will be forthcoming with some degree of certainty
if the symptoms cease immediately after the removal of the parasites.
As a whole series of troubles, which certainly have nothing to do
with them, are erroneously ascribed to the tapeworm, as is frequently
assumed, one will do well to be somewhat critical in this respect.</p>

<p>The treatment is of a threefold nature: prophylactic, symptomatic
and radical.</p>

<p>Under any circumstances, the best prophylaxis is that which
consists in only eating the flesh of those animals in which any of the
three larval forms occur (pig, cattle, salmon, pike, burbot, etc.)
so prepared that the larval forms have been destroyed and the food
thus rendered innocuous. For domestic and public use the rule
prescribed by KÃ¼chenmeister is under all circumstances most easily
understood, namely to roast or boil till the flesh appear greyish-white
and sufficiently done by reason of the coagulation of the
albumen and decolorization of the blood. The general prophylaxis
simply concerns the tapeworm carriers trying to limit as far as
possible the further extension of the parasites in the animal world
by carefully rendering the expelled segments and worms harmless
(pouring sulphuric acid over the fÃ¦ces and burning the worms) and
also by strictly adhering to official regulations. The official system
of meat inspection in this respect has been of immense service, and
much can still be done by means of thorough official control over
cleanliness in abattoirs and butchersâ shops. Galli-Valerio<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a> very<span class="pagenum" title="669"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669"></a></span>
rightly desires the abolition of the custom of manuring fruit-plants
such as strawberries, vegetables and salad with the contents of privies,
and would extend the use of privies in the country.</p>

<p>Symptomatic treatment consists, in the case of those TÃ¦niÃ¦ which
resist radical attempts at expulsion, of repeated use of drugs injurious
to the worm as soon as ever new proglottides are formed, or in
special cases, as in the case of persons weakened by diseases or
operations, or frail old people, or patients with severe heart failure,
gastric or intestinal carcinoma, or in pregnancy, in effecting the
expulsion of a large chain of proglottides by the mildest measures
possible.</p>

<p>Radical treatment of the TÃ¦nia is not always equally easy in all
three species, even when the means used are the same; the easiest to
expel is <i>T. solium</i>, then <i>D. latus</i>, and the most difficult <i>T. saginata</i>.
That as yet no certain cure exists for Cestodes is clear from the large
number of drugs recommended from time to time, and the increase
of bungling treatment in this respect; in addition, there is no department
in which there is so much quackery as in vermifuges. The
treatment proper should always be preceded by thorough preparatory
treatment, the purpose of which is to render the gut as empty as
possible once for all, and on the other hand to put the worms themselves
into a diseased condition. How far the host himself has been
made ill by such preliminary cures (herring, pickle, garlic, onions,
preserved strawberries), many a person who has had to do with such
things can recount. In the opinion of Fischer<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> strict preparatory
treatment appears to favour the development of toxic substances, or
else it disposes to vomiting; as a rule it causes the patient far more
discomfort than the treatment itself. In recent times far less weight
is attached to these preparatory treatments than to carefully prepared
and correctly dosed drugs; the preparation is generally limited to
relieving the intestine in a simple way, the day before the treatment,
of the densest fÃ¦cal masses, by a simple aperient or water enema.</p>

<p>We recommend the following, which has always proved itself to
be the best and simplest remedy against <i>T. saginata</i>. The patient
takes early in the evening before the treatment nothing but a plate of
soup or a glass of milk, and then takes a laxative (electuar. lenit or
infus. sennÃ¦ compos. or an enema), so that later in the evening one
to two stools are passed. In this connection we fail to agree with
Grawitz<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> and Boas,<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a> who consider that at least preliminary evacuation
of the intestines can be dispensed with. On the following<span class="pagenum" title="670"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670"></a></span>
morning the patient should take a cup of black coffee or tea without
anything else, and half an hour later the vermifuge.</p>

<p>The best drug is extract. filicis maris Ã¦ther., which also forms the
main constituent of most of the secret remedies recommended for
tapeworms. Earlier mishaps with this preparation had their origin
principally in insufficient dosage. Also, in addition to correct dosage,
extract. filic. maris needs very careful preparation if satisfactory results
are to be attained. If preparations with the trade mark âHelfenbergâ
or âWohnarâ are not used, but the male fern extract has been
prepared by a chemist, one must make certain that the roots of the
<i>Aspidium filix-mas</i> have been collected in May or October, and only
green sappy specimens selected, and that the attached paleÃ¦ have
been separated, that they have been broken up small and ether
poured over them with a little spirits of wine while quite fresh. The
whole mass is to be kept in a cool place, but not too closely covered.
If at any time a certain quantity is to be used, it is taken out, the
ether carefully distilled in a retort till the extract has a suitable fluid
consistency. Fischer attaches great importance to the direction in
the PharmacopÅia being exactly followed, to the effect that the
extract is to be carefully stirred before prescribing, as the active substances
undergo partial crystallization if kept for any length of time
and sink to the bottom, so that the preparation has a different strength
and toxicity in different layers. Of this extract 10 to 12 to 15&nbsp;grm. are
to be taken in gelatine capsules within half an hour. We consider it
unjustifiable to give greater doses than 15&nbsp;grm. to adults, as many
cases are known in which to some extent severe toxic symptoms have
followed, such as headache, sensation of giddiness, dyspnÅa and
cyanosis, yellow vision (xanthopsia), delirium, stupor, the most severe
cramps in the extremities, rapidly fatal trismus and tetanus. The
most serious are defects of vision of various kinds, which may end
in amblyopia and amaurosis, with permanent blindness. A complete
collection of toxicological literature up to the year 1903 is to be
found in Marxâs<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a> Dissertation. Since that time further instances
of such intoxications have been made known. Nagel<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a> observed
them only in severe cases. O. Meyer<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a> lays special stress on the bad
prognosis of the disturbances of vision evoked by poisoning with
extract. filicis maris. Studt<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a> has seen two cases of optic neuritis, one
with circumscribed, the other with diffuse retinal Ådema. Uhthoff<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a>
has only seen one case; in that reported by Noiszewski<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> the toxic
retinitis was cured; in Viereckâs<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a> case bilateral concentric limitation<span class="pagenum" title="671"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671"></a></span>

filicis maris. Stuelp<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a> attributes the amaurosis occurring after taking
filix mas to a toxic action on the muscularis of the central retinal
artery; there followed paralysis of the vessel, vascular engorgement,
and thereby nutritional defects of the nervous elements followed.
In children one has to diminish the dose correspondingly, as with
them, still more so than with adults, severe disturbances arise. Huber<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a>
claims that this drug should not be given to children indiscriminately.
The view is frequently expressed that a combination of extractum
filicis maris with fatty oils in which the active constituents are soluble
favours intoxication. Marx<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> also argues from this standpoint and
assumes that the ideal preparation, free from objection, would be got
if from filix-mas extract a preparation free from fatty oils could be
made, and he considers it advisable to limit the use of castor oil as an
aperient before and after taking the âcureâ and to prescribe instead
a saline laxative, such as Epsom salts or Glauberâs salts. Sonnenschein<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a>
also advises against the simultaneous exhibition of extractum
filicis maris with oleum ricini, as is the case with Helfenbergâs
capsules, and Boas<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a> is likewise anxious that ol. ricini should be
avoided. Lenhartz<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a> appears to consider the warning against the
simultaneous combination of the extract with fats or ethereal oils, and
especially against the employment of castor oil as an after-treatment,
as without justification, and we, too, in the course of our many
filix treatments, have never yet witnessed any unfavourable effect from
the use of castor oil in the after-treatment. The surest way of
obviating the toxic effects of extractum filicis is to give a laxative
(ol. ricini) as soon as the extract has left the stomach, say, about half
an hour, so that it need not stay longer than necessary in the gut and
become absorbed. Perhaps in most cases of poisoning, transgressions
against this rule have been the cause of the toxic action. The nausea
that sets in the day after taking the drug and the inclination to vomit
are best resisted by giving iced coffee, iced tea, iced pills, peppermint
tea, cognac, one to two wafer powders of menthol and sacch. lactis
ÄÄ 0Â·2&nbsp;grm. (Apolant<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a>) half an hour before the drug is taken.
Fischer<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">754</a> considers that lying still in the horizontal position is the
best remedy. Boas<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> recommends the injection of the drug into the
stomachs of patients who tolerate extractum filicis badly, in the form of
a thin emulsion (with gi. arab.). In the case of children the extract<span class="pagenum" title="672"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672"></a></span>
is prescribed with honey as an electuary. The method recommended
by Fowler<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">756</a> is without doubt too detailed; he prescribes before the
treatment two to three to four daysâ rest in bed; special diet, tablets of
cascara sagrada three times daily, on the fourth day senna infusion,
and then to give the extractum filicis maris in capsules in four doses,
to be taken every quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Under Jaquetâs<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">757</a> direction, Kraft has prepared an amorphous acid
from the fern root extract which is designated filmaron. As a vermifuge
the drug is prescribed for children of 2 to 5 years of age in
doses up to 0Â·2 to 0Â·3&nbsp;grm., for children of from 8 to 12 years in doses
up to 0Â·5 to 0Â·7&nbsp;grm., and for adults up to 0Â·7 to 1Â·0&nbsp;grm., so as to expel
the parasites. Bodenstein<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a> gives the filmaron oil introduced into
commerce by the firm of Boehringer (one part filmaron and nine parts
castor oil) in still greater dosage, either fasting or, in the case of
sensitive patients, one hour after a cup of tea; he gives peppermint
tablets against possible nausea. Brieger<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> tested the preparation in
twenty-three cases; in twenty-one of these he prescribed it as an ether-castor
oil mixture, and in two as capsules. The action always took
effect in from two to five hours, and only in three cases were
unpleasant after-effects in the shape of colic observed; in sixteen
cases the result was positive, in seven negative.</p>

<p>The attempts made by Goldmann<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> to prepare from the bark of
<i>Musenna abyssinica</i>, a plant of the order <i>MyrsinaceÃ¦</i>, indigenous to
Persia, the active substance, namely sebirol, have shown that when
this is given alone it certainly acts as a vermicide, but not as a
vermifuge; on the other hand, the results of a combination of sebirol
with thymol and salicylates were surprisingly good; this mixture has
been introduced into commerce as tÃ¦niol, in the shape of pastilles
prepared with chocolate for children. The method of giving tÃ¦niol
is as follows: On the day before the administration a light diet and
thorough purging with calomel are ordered; and then on the day of
the treatment itself, after a breakfast consisting of a cup of tea, in the
case of adults, thirteen to fifteen tÃ¦niol pastilles are taken in some red
wine at intervals of ten minutes respectively. In the middle of this
treatment an interval of some hours is interposed. After the pastilles
have been taken a calomel purge is again given. The results obtained
by Liermberger<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> are sufficiently encouraging to be put to further test.</p>

<p>Fischer<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">762</a> has tested in some of his cases extracts of some new
species of fern root; he employed the extract from the rhizomes of<span class="pagenum" title="673"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673"></a></span>
<i>Aspidium spinulosum</i> and <i>A. dilatatum</i>, two fern roots indigenous to
Sweden, and obtained remarkable results (doses of 4&nbsp;grm.). LaurÃ©n<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">763</a>
had previously recorded similar results, and recently Friedjung,<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">764</a>
using extr. aspid. spinulos.</p>

<p>Cortex radicis granati as fresh bark is a very good drug, and is
usually given as a decoction: 180Â·0 bark to 1,000Â·0 water, boiled for
forty hours to 240Â·0, and a small cupful to be given every half an hour;
colic, vomiting and diarrhÅa, are, however, easily induced. The chief
constituent of the granate root, pelletierinum, possesses vermicidal
properties, and is much recommended, especially in France. SequelÃ¦
easily arise (vertigo, hazy vision, malaise, vomiting, quickened heartâs
action, muscular tremors, cramps in the calves), especially in delicate
persons and children, so that one should refrain from giving it to the
latter especially (Drivon<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">765</a>). Sometimes, judging by the experience of
Sobotta<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> and Boas,<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> the action is problematical. Where it is desired
to employ it in the case of adults, the following is prescribed: pellet.
sulfur. 0Â·3 to 0Â·4&nbsp;grm., acid. tannic. 0Â·5&nbsp;grm., sir. rub. jd. 30Â·0&nbsp;grm., to
be taken at one time, and a quarter to half an hour after a purgative
(senna infusion). In the case of children it is better to employ
semina cucurbitÃ¦ maximÃ¦ instead of extractum filicis maris. Sixty
to 100 pumpkin seeds are pounded up with sugar, which yield a
pleasant-tasting electuary, and which are taken all at once; half an
hour afterwards a laxative is taken (Storch,<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">768</a> Pick<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">769</a>), Jungklaussâs
preparation is nothing else than a pumpkin extract; its action is
favourable; it is, however, too expensive (Ritter<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">770</a>). Flores kousso
up to 15 to 20&nbsp;grm. in compressed form or in sugar or honey in the
form of electuaries (children 2Â·0 to 10Â·0&nbsp;grm. according to age) is not to
be relied upon; kussin, prepared from kousso flowers (Bedall, Munich),
is not a pure body; when taken it is divided into four parts up to
1Â·0 to 2Â·0&nbsp;grm. with elÃ¦osaccharum menthÃ¦, at half-hourly intervals;
it is said to be less unpleasant than treatment with flores kousso (Liebreich
and Langgard<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">771</a>). Kosinum crystallisatum (dose 1Â·5 to 2Â·0&nbsp;grm.)
is prepared by the firm of Merck. Kamala is the least potent of the
tapeworm drugs in use, and is principally to be recommended in the
treatment of children: 1Â·5 to 3Â·0&nbsp;grm. in electuaries. According to
Leichtenstern<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> and White<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">773</a> chloroform, even in toxic doses, cannot<span class="pagenum" title="674"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674"></a></span>
do any harm to the tapeworm, nevertheless it has been recently
recommended by CarratÃº<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">774</a>; chloroform 6Â·0, sirup. 60Â·0, one teaspoonful
to be taken every hour (fasting). Salol is recommended by
Galli-Valerio<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">775</a> as an absolutely harmless tapeworm drug; thymotal
(a derivative of thymol) by Pool,<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">776</a> 3&nbsp;grm. to be given up to three to
four times on four consecutive days.</p>

<p>The drug well known long ago, cuprum oxyd. nigr., has been
recently brought into fresh notice by DÃ¶rr.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">777</a> It is also the chief constituent
of the tapeworm drug introduced into commerce by the firm
of Dehlsen (Itzehoe) (Koch<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">778</a>). The coconut is absolutely ineffectual,
also naphthalin, croton-chloral, ether, gallanol, strontium lactate,
glycerine and bromide of potash.</p>

<p>Where possible one should endeavour to discover the head or the
heads of the tapeworm in the stools, so as to make certain whether
the treatment has been successful; this search is best carried out by
immediately and carefully pouring water over the total quantity of
evacuations collected in the night stool, without stirring them up, till
only the tapeworm is found lying at the bottom of the vessel.</p>


<h5>NEMATODES.</h5>

<p class="tac"><b>Strongyloides stercoralis.</b></p>

<p>The pathological significance of this intestinal parasite is not yet
fully demonstrated. In Seifertâs<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> observation, on what Leichtenstern<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">780</a>
called the celebrated WÃ¼rzburg case, the patient had suffered many
times from attacks of blood-stained diarrhÅa with tenesmus, as in
Zinnâs<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">781</a> case of a three year old boy who had bloody purulent diarrhÅa.
SchlÃ¼ter<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> speaks of a hÃ¦morrhagic enteritis produced by Strongyloides.
In other cases besides diarrhÅa (either with or without blood) there
were noted: pains in the body (SchlÃ¼ter), tenderness of the abdomen,
loss of appetite, gastric troubles of a general kind, headache, giddiness,
fainting attacks, anÃ¦mia (Silvestri,<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> Valdes,<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> and Trappe<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">785</a>), so
that even if in isolated cases (FÃ¼lleborn<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">786</a>) symptoms are absent, some
significance cannot be denied these parasites as a matter of course<span class="pagenum" title="675"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675"></a></span>
(Bruns,<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">787</a> Leichtenstern<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">788</a>). According to Kurlow,<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">789</a> in Siberia there is a
form of sporadic bloody diarrhÅa which has its origin in the presence
of <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i>. The parasite does not live only in the
intestinal lumen, but also in the intestinal wall, where it causes
abscesses, fistulÃ¦ and effusions of blood.</p>

<p>Diagnosis is easily made by the detection of the actively moving
larvÃ¦ in the stools.</p>

<p>Treatment is rather difficult, as it is not always successful in
getting rid of the parasites. Authors differ as to the effectiveness of
extr. fil. maris. Goldmann<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> still considers this preparation as the most
effective; he recommends preliminary treatment with calomel 0Â·2&nbsp;grm.
and tuber. jalapÃ¦ 0Â·5&nbsp;grm. a day before the special treatment, which
consists of gelatine capsules of 15Â·0&nbsp;grm. extr. fil. maris (to be taken
in the course of four hours); afterwards rectified oil of turpentine
in gelatine capsules. The thymol treatment (<i>vide</i> Ancylostomiasis,
p. 682), thymol alone or in combination with calomel (SchlÃ¼ter,<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">791</a> Valdes,<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">792</a>
Soussino,<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">793</a> Goldmann<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">794</a>), has often caused diminution of the number
of larvÃ¦, but also often remains resultless. Teissier<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">795</a> maintains that by
degrees he procured complete cure by the administration of mercury
in the form of blue pill. In our case neither thymol nor calomel,
santonin, extr. fil. maris, decoct, rad. granat., had any result whatever.
Davaine<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">796</a> believes he attained decrease and final disappearance of
the larvÃ¦ by protracted milk-cure. Santonin, tannalbin and other
preparations seem ineffectual. Tannin enemata (Mildner<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">797</a>), high
injections with starch enemata (SchlÃ¼ter<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">798</a>), may alleviate in persistent
diarrhÅa. Travellers who are visiting regions the native home of
Strongyloides must exercise the most extreme care and scrupulous
cleanliness, and these are also necessary in patients already suffering
from Strongyloides, to prevent auto-reinfection (Trappe<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">799</a>).</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Dracunculus medinensis</b> (Dracontiasis).</p>

<p>The guinea worm develops in the dermis of human beings without
any symptoms; only when it is completely grown does it form
boil-like, extremely painful abscesses, in the greater majority of cases
in the legs, in the region of the ankle, and is accompanied by general
disturbance and a feeling of heaviness, dragging and pricking of the<span class="pagenum" title="676"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676"></a></span>
affected part; it occurs more rarely in the arms, certain parts of the
back, the head, neck, scrotum and penis; in a superficial position
the worm can occasionally be felt through the skin. In most cases
there is only one worm and one abscess, but here and there one finds
patients with three, four or even up to eight worms, and very exceptionally
still more, as in the cases described by PoupÃ©e-Desportes<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">800</a>
(fifty worms) and by Harington<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> (seventeen worms).</p>

<p>Diagnosis offers no difficulty when the worms are presenting or
can be felt under the skin.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the native home of the guinea worm, as a rule,
quietly wait till it has got so far out that it can be conveniently
grasped; it is then bound round with thread and fastened between
the tips of a split piece of wood and slowly wound out. In ten to
twelve days it can be wound out in this way. Emily<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> makes injections
of a 1 in 1,000 solution of sublimate either in the neighbourhood
of the worm or directly into its body. Mense<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> managed to
remove the worm in one sitting by laying a wad of cotton wool
soaked in chloroform on the exposed portion, thus stupefying it.
Our therapeutic observations (Frangenheim<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">804</a>) favour the free laying
open of the existing abscess and the consequent complete extraction
of the worm.</p>

<p>Prophylaxis depends on care in the use of water in the guinea
worm countries, especially dangerous being permanent waters infested
by <i>Cyclops</i> sp.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Filaria bancrofti.</b></p>

<p>The parasitism of this filaria leads to the formation of lymphangitis,
elephantiasis, chyluria, orchitis, chylocele, abscesses, lymphatic varices,
perhaps also to chylous ascites and chylous diarrhÅa.</p>

<p>Lymphangitis usually attacks the extremities, beginning generally
with a rigor and swelling of the lymphatic vessels with adjoining
lymph glands. The lymphatics become hard, knotty and extremely
painful, the overlying skin red and swollen in longitudinal lines
(Looss), high fever sets in with, to some extent, severe general disturbance.
After some days the attack subsides, the swelling then
partially disappears, but not completely, and often abscesses develop
in consequence of the lymphangitis. Children, as a rule, suffer from
such lymphangitic attacks (Finucane<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">805</a>).</p>

<p>Diagnosis is not easy, for many other causes frequently produce
lymphangitis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="677"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677"></a></span></p>

<p>Treatment consists in rest, raising the affected limb, applications
of vinegar and alum or liquor plumbi, in some cases incisions into the
swollen part under antiseptic precautions.</p>

<p><i>Elephantiasis</i> (<i>Arabian</i>) is usually situated in the lower extremities,
in men in the scrotum and penis, in women in the labium pudendi,
mons veneris, and the mammÃ¦; more rarely it attacks the upper
extremities or, indeed, the head. The disease develops during repeated
attacks, which occur at irregular intervals of weeks, months or years,
of fever accompanied by symptoms of lymphangitis and erysipelas
(<i>elephantoid</i> fever), and especially as the result of different accidental
occurrences such as chills, bodily exertions, external irritation. The
extremities become shapeless, heavy cylinders, the scrotum occasionally
a colossal tumour, the female genitalia and the mammÃ¦ smaller or
larger tumours; the penis often shares in the general thickening, the
inguinal glands form large hard prominent masses, and enormous
deformity is caused. The cause is more often seen in men than
women, rarely in children over 10, never in younger children.</p>

<p>Treatment of elephantiasis of the extremities consists in raising the
affected part, massage, bandaging, vapour baths; the large elephantoid
tumours of the genitalia and mammÃ¦ can only be treated by operative
removal.</p>

<p>Chyluria (hÃ¦mato-chyluria), as a rule, begins by a series of attacks
and often ceases for weeks or months, the attacks being accompanied
by fever, pain in the back and lumbar region, about the kidneys and
in the perinÃ¦um. The attacks are separated by intervals of monthsâ
or even yearsâ duration, a continuous chyluria being quite rare. The
disease may last many years without the constitution being markedly
weakened, but in other cases anÃ¦mia and debility ensue and result
in death from marasmus. In chyluria the urine becomes completely
opaque like milk; but sometimes, from the presence of blood, is of a
peach-like redness: the sediment contains clotted blood, and microscopically
one finds fine dust-like fat granules and red cells and
leucocytes, and usually, but not always, filaria larvÃ¦. Sclerodermia
may possibly be caused by Filaria (Bancroft<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">806</a>).</p>

<p>Treatment, consists in administration of ol. santali, methylene blue
(0Â·12&nbsp;grm. dose several times daily), ichthyol (in pills from 0Â·5 to
1Â·5&nbsp;grm. per day), ol. terebinthinÃ¦ (0Â·5 to 1Â·5&nbsp;gr. per day), thymol
(Ziemann<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> had no result from either thymol or methylene blue),
together with absolute rest in bed, diminution of all fatty nourishment
and administration of light purgatives.</p>

<p>Orchitis is in acute attacks a relatively frequent symptom in
the East; the chylocele is rarely marked; the fluid usually shows<span class="pagenum" title="678"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678"></a></span>
numerous larvÃ¦; in the case of abscesses they are generally caused
directly by the adult parasites, as they have often been found in them;
varices of the lymphatic vessels are either superficial or deep;
lymphorrhagia arises from rupture of the dilated vessels; chylous
ascites and chylous diarrhÅa may also be produced by FilariÃ¦.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Loa loa.</b></p>

<p><i>Loa loa</i>, according to modern investigations, is a parasite of the
subcutaneous connective tissue of man, and its appearance in the
conjunctiva somewhat accidental; in earlier times it seems to have
been less common (Ziemann<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">808</a>). A number of cases are seen in
Europe of patients who have lived in filaria regions, and on return
have been found to have this Nematode in the subconjunctival tissue.
Pick,<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">809</a> in the case of a man who had lived in the Cameroons,
found the parasites in active motion under the connective tissue of
the eyeball right over the cornea; extraction was easy. Ziemann<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">810</a>
noted three cases of <i>Loa loa</i> in the eye accompanied by temporary
migratory swellings in different parts of the body. In one case,
observed by Wurtz and Cleri<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">811</a> (a woman from the French Congo),
<i>Loa loa</i> was the cause of intermittent elastic swellings in the
subcutaneous and subconjunctival tissue (marked eosinophilia). In
the case recorded by Pollack<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> (for thirty years police commissioner
in the Cameroons) the worm under the connective tissue of the left
eye by its snake-like movements caused an unpleasant itching. With
cocaine and adrenalin the worm can be made visible, and by means
of a strabismus hook can be drawn out of a small wound in the
connective tissue. Martens<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">813</a> exhibited a Filaria extracted from the
eyelid under local anÃ¦sthesia.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Trichuris trichiura.</b></p>

parasite of the large intestine (Leichtenstern,<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> Eichhorst,<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">815</a>
Askanazy<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">816</a>), the number of severe and even fatal cases of diseases
caused by it (trichocephaliasis) increase so much that the <i>Trichuris
trichiura</i> must be excluded from the group of harmless intestinal
parasites. (For disturbances of the nervous system and of the blood<span class="pagenum" title="679"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679"></a></span>
[anÃ¦mia] from trichocephaliasis, <i>see</i> p.&nbsp;650). Infection in human
beings results from the eggs that have developed outside the body,
which probably reach the digestive tract on the hands soiled with dirt
or earth, or possibly through drinking water. (Moosbrugger<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> and
Kahane<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a> mention in their cases that the children had an absolute
passion for earth-eating.) Possibly, too, patients reinfect themselves
anew, as an intermediate host is not necessary.</p>

<p>The anterior part of the body of the parasite is usually fixed in the
mucous membrane, and according to Askanazy feeds on the blood
of its host. Moosbrugger,<a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> Schulze,<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">819</a> Kahane,<a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a> Vix,<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">820</a> Girard<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a> and
Blanchard<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">822</a> all found changes in the mucous membrane of the gut,
showing that the parasites had been in the gut for a considerable
time. Kahane<a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a> had an opportunity of seeing at the Pasteur
Institute Trichocephali with the anterior part of the body penetrating
not only the mucosa but also deep into the muscularis of the gut
wall. From this mode of attachment to the wall it is easily understood
how Trichocephali, especially when they are numerous in the
gut, cause local irritation and inflammatory conditions consisting of
frequent attacks of diarrhÅa, sometimes twenty times a day, lasting
for months, resisting all remedies, and often accompanied by colicky
pains and symptoms of peritonitis. The stools often have blood
mixed with the fluid, very glassy, jelly-like mucus, more or less
abundantly as in the cases of Moesasca, Moosbrugger,<a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> Kahane,<a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a>
Girard,<a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a> Poledne,<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">823</a> and Rippe.<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">824</a> Nausea and vomiting are rarer
symptoms.</p>

<p>Diagnosis as a rule can only be made by microscopical examination
of the stools; together with the eggs, regular and beautifully
formed Charcot-Leyden crystals occur.</p>

<p>The prognosis is unfavourable in severe infections, in slighter
cases, where only a few worms are present, the danger of important
symptoms is less. Treatment consists in administration <i>per os</i> of
vermicides and in local treatment of the large gut. A remedy which
was once much used was calomel, which is much lauded by Gibson
and given as follows: calomel 0Â·06&nbsp;grm., rheum. 0Â·3&nbsp;grm., tinct. ferri
sesquichlor. 1Â·2&nbsp;c.c., aq. dest. 90Â·0&nbsp;grm., six dessert-spoonfuls three times
daily. Rippe appears to have got no result from the use of this prescription.
Thymol, especially in conjunction with local treatment of<span class="pagenum" title="680"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680"></a></span>
the large intestine, had unquestionably some effect in certain cases,
such as those of Girard, Poledne, Hausmann, Kahane and Schiller.
The local treatment of the large bowel is most effectual when high injections
of water and benzine are given. Becker<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">825</a> obviously used too
much benzine (1 dessert-spoonful to 1 litre of water), for severe
irritation was set up, whilst Peiper<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">826</a> used only a few drops of benzine,
5 drops to 1 litre of water being enough (Schiller). Instead of
benzine enemata, garlic, 1 per cent. thymol solution, and physiological
saline injections have been used, but the benzine enemata seem to be
far and away the most effective. In Schillerâs case 2,000 worms came
away on the first day as the result of such a combined treatment
(thymol internally and benzine enemata).</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Trichinella spiralis.</b></p>

<p>Trichinosis is, happily, becoming so much rarer that many
doctors get no opportunity, either in their student days or in private
practice, of seeing this severe disease; we ourselves remember having
observed one typical case of a peasant, aged 17, from Metz in Med.-Rat
Merkelâs clinic in Nuremberg in the year 1879. In the description
of the disease we follow Merkelâs<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> observations.</p>

<p>The eating of flesh containing TrichinÃ¦ is often followed, if not
invariably so, by gastric disturbances of different kinds, especially by
vomiting and diarrhÅa, with colic, great muscular fatigue, Ådema
of the eyelids, muscular swellings with hardness and extreme painfulness,
disturbance of ocular movements, of deglutition and of breathing,
hoarseness, aphonia, intestinal hÃ¦morrhage, bleeding of the nose,
ecchymosis of the skin and mucosÃ¦, prurigo, herpes, miliaria, pustules,
boils, severe sweating, Ådema of the extremities, and, finally,
desquamation of the skin; more rarely there is considerable
decubitus, bronchial catarrh, hypostatic and catarrhal pneumonia,
with dry and purulent pleurisy, and in severe cases symptoms of
collapse with delirium close the scene. Slight cases last from three
to six weeks, severe ones for several months, and in the latter
convalescence is very slow. It is remarkable that in cases of
trichinosis of long duration, cancer of the breast was observed at
the same time (Klopsch,<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">828</a> Langenbeck,<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">829</a> Babes<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">830</a>). Death during
epidemics occurred in 30 per cent. of all cases. The disease begins<span class="pagenum" title="681"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681"></a></span>
generally from one to ten days after eating trichinous flesh, yet there
have been cases noted in which the disease began several weeks after.</p>

<p>Diagnosis in the presence of several cases, or in epidemics, is not
difficult, but in isolated cases, on the other hand, it is not easy.
If there is a suspicion of trichinosis, from the muscular fatigue and
the Ådema of the eyelids, the diagnosis can be made by excision of
a piece of muscle and by finding the TrichinÃ¦ in the tissue, taken
with the results of the examination of the previously eaten sausage or
meat. In contradistinction to this circumstantial process, there is
the examination of the blood, which, according to Schleip<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">831</a>
(Homburg trichinosis epidemic, August 19 to 26, 1903, 130 cases), is
the most valuable method of diagnosing trichinosis when the TrichinÃ¦
have not yet penetrated the muscles, for a blood examination shows
a large increase in the numbers of the eosinophile cells; StÃ¤ubli
detected his seven cases in this way, four of the severe ones showing
a marked hyperleucocytosis, and a combination of Kernigâs sign with
absence of the patellar reflex. On account of the rarity of these two
signs in combination in other infective diseases, they have a certain
diagnostic value. StÃ¤ubli<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">832</a> also observed in trichinosis the constant
appearance of a remarkably strong positive diazo-reaction of the
urine.</p>

<p>Prophylaxis in trichinosis is fully considered under <i>Trichinella
spiralis</i> (p.&nbsp;429).</p>

<p>Treatment consists in those cases where it is known that trichinous
flesh has been swallowed in the first place of washing out the
stomach, but still more in a thorough evacuation of the bowels, for
which calomel (0Â·5&nbsp;grm.), ol. ricini (a dessert-spoonful till the action
becomes marked), infusion of senna with sulphate of magnesia and
large enemata are employed, and should be repeated at intervals
during the first few weeks. Alcohol (cognac up to 250&nbsp;c.c. a
day) is recommended by some, also glycerine (150&nbsp;grm. at a dose)
and large doses of dilute hydrochloric acid. Beside these, a large
number of other remedies are recommended, of which, perhaps,
benzine and thymol, especially in the form of enemata, are worthy
of notice.</p>

<p>When the disease is fully developed the treatment should be
symptomatic; a protracted practically continuous luke-warm bath is
especially useful.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Eustrongylus gigas.</b></p>

<p><i>Eustrongylus gigas</i> is most frequently found in the pelvis of the
kidney. Infection in the majority of cases leads to pyelitis. The<span class="pagenum" title="682"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682"></a></span>
inflammation extends to the capsule from the pelvis, resulting in a
purulent nephritis. In infections of longer duration, the affected
kidneys become changed into so-called kidney sacs, while the kidney
itself continuously shrinks. Owing to the worm fixing its posterior end
in the ureter, and owing to an inflammatory swelling of the mucosa
of the ureter, the passage of urine becomes very difficult.</p>

<p>The symptoms resemble those caused by a foreign body, <i>e.g.</i>,
kidney pain, suppression of urine, dysuria, discharge of blood and
pus with the urine. But these symptoms are not sufficient for
a diagnosis; this can only be established by finding eggs or the
parasite itself in the urine.</p>

<p>Moscato<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">833</a> records a case with chyluria, pain in the region of the
right kidney, and hysterical symptoms. During an hysterical attack
a specimen of <i>Eustrongylus gigas</i> was discharged in the urine, and the
chyluria and nervous affections disappeared. In a case described
by Stuertz<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">834</a> of an Australian with chyluria due to <i>Eustrongylus gigas</i>
the chyluria had existed for seven years. In the urine the eggs of
<i>Eustrongylus gigas</i> were found. The cystoscopic examination showed
that turbid urine was discharging from the left ureter. Nephrectomy
was considered.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Ancylostoma duodenale</b> (Ancylostomiasis).</p>

<p>Whilst up to quite modern times it has been generally maintained
that the great majority of worm diseases cause more or less marked
symptoms, the exact investigations of the last few years have made
it plain that the great majority of people with worms are not only
perfectly healthy, but the most careful clinical observations show no
single sign of any ill-effect of the intestinal parasites on the health
of the host (LÃ¶bker and Bruns<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">835</a>). If infection has led to the
development of only a few ancylostomes, then injury to the general
health is, as a rule, scarcely noticeable. In order to produce severe
illness the presence of several hundred worms in the intestine is
necessary, and in general the intensity of illness varies in exact
proportion to the number of worms. Then the duration of the infection
comes into play: the longer the human organism is submitted
to the injurious effect of the parasite, the clearer is the effect on the
host. Besides, the resistance of the individual has to be considered.
Whilst a more robust person can harbour without ill-effect for a
longer time a larger number of ancylostomes, the symptoms of the
disease become more markedly and much sooner apparent in weakly
persons or in those weakened by other diseases.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="683"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683"></a></span></p>
<p>The first symptom is disturbance of the digestive system; more
often there is a feeling of pain in the epigastrium, more severe upon
pressure, heartburn, nausea, vomiting of mucus or food at different
times of the day (occasionally ancylostome ova have been found in
the vomit). Whether the eggs which reach the frontal sinus with the
vomit can develop into larvÃ¦ there is questionable, but the records
of v. Ziemssen<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">836</a> and Huppertz,<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">837</a> to the effect that in some instances
ancylostomes have been discharged from the frontal sinus, are of
interest. The five cases recorded by the latter had a fatal termination
from Ådematous swellings of the face with severe inflammation of
the meninges. The tongue is furred, and extensive catarrhal stomatitis
and ptyalism are recorded. The appetite is variable, increasing
or diminishing, there is loathing of nourishment or a marked longing
for acid food and unripe fruit, whilst ordinary meals are rejected.
At first there is often constipation, later diarrhÅa with abundant
mucus, and often blood in the stools; microscopically eggs and
Charcot-Leyden crystals were found.</p>

<p>In the further course of the disease symptoms due to increasing
anÃ¦mia predominate; the hÃ¦moglobin of the blood diminishes from
one-fourth to one-fifth of the normal (Baravalle<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">838</a>), the eosinophile cells
increase considerably (Boycott,<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> Lohr<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">840</a>), yet in regard to diagnosis
eosinophilia cannot be regarded as of equal value to a microscopical
examination of the fÃ¦ces (Bruns, Liefmann, and Meckel<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">841</a>). The disturbances
of the circulatory system take the form of more or less
severe palpitation, pain in the region of the heart, quick pulse, Ådema
of the eyelids, of the face, of the lower limbs, and even of the whole
body. Disturbance of the sexual functions (impotence, irregular
menstruation, delayed onset of puberty) are not infrequently observed.</p>

<p>Infection in human beings takes place by the mouth, if uncleansed
vegetables are eaten&mdash;in Japan especially, where human fÃ¦ces are used&mdash;and
articles of food are not sufficiently carefully cleaned (Inouye<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">842</a>),
or from putting food into the mouth with dirty hands. Looss<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">843</a> does
not think that drinking water is dangerous as a rule, for the larvÃ¦
sink to the bottom in standing water, and are only brought to the
top by shaking. Looss has done most valuable service by discovering
that infection can arise also through the skin. During the last few
years so many authors have confirmed this at first doubted source<span class="pagenum" title="684"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684"></a></span>
of infection, that one must accept this source of infection now, even
though it is undecided which mode of infection is the more prevalent,
by the mouth or through the skin. Some authors have described
the changes induced in the skin by the penetration of the larvÃ¦; for
instance, Looss and Schaudinn,<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">844</a> itching papules in their own skin,
and Dieminger<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> a skin affection in the Graf Schwerin mine which
was called the âSchweriner itch,â and a skin affection not unlike
scabies in the tea plantations of Assam and South America; pani-ghao
(water itch) (Dubreuilh<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">846</a>); the penetration of the larvÃ¦ through
the skin also explains the frequent appearance of boils and itching
purulent eczema in miners in infected pits (Goldmann<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">847</a>).</p>

<p>The absolute diagnosis of ancylostomiasis depends on the detection
of the ancylostome eggs in the fÃ¦ces, and presents no difficulties.</p>

<p>Prophylaxis is of the greatest importance, especially to miners.
The spread of ancylostomiasis seems to depend only on fÃ¦ces
deposited in damp places, so that on the one hand the deposition
of fÃ¦ces must be prevented, and on the other the fÃ¦ces must be
rendered as far as possible harmless; in addition, there is the
individual prophylaxis.</p>

<p>General prophylaxis <span class="nowrap">requires:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) Examination immediately for ancylostomes of miners seeking
work and of those newly taken on five to six weeks after.</p>

<p>(2) Indentured workers who are infected with worms are not
allowed to work underground until a medical certificate in writing
is brought to the effect that they are no more infected with eggs (the
same procedure applies to workmen in brick kilns) (Goldmann<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">848</a>).</p>

<p>(3) Indentured workers infected with worms must submit themselves
to the prescribed treatment, and after its completion further
submit their stools to three examinations at intervals of about four
weeks.</p>

<p>(4) Special supervision of miners and brick-makers coming from
the Italian frontier.</p>

<p>(5) Workmen must be given instructions, both by word of mouth
and in writing in their mother tongue, as to the infectivity and danger
of ancylostomiasis both to themselves and others.</p>

<p>(6) Orders are to be given as to washing, baths, and changing
of clothes at the end of the work.</p>

<p>(7) During the hours of working in the pits, taking of food is
strictly forbidden without thorough and entire washing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="685"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685"></a></span></p>

<p>(8) All privies must be so arranged that the vessels used for the
reception of the excreta must not leak, must be protected by a cover,
and easily transportable. The emptying of these vessels must be
carried out in specially constructed impenetrable pits.</p>

<p>(9) DefÃ¦cation in any other place than a privy is forbidden (alike
for miners and brick-makers).</p>

<p>(10) The manure of horses used in the mines is to be regularly
removed; possibly infection takes place in this way also. [This is
impossible.&mdash;J.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;S.]</p>

<p>How far it is possible to disinfect a mine already severely infected
is a matter of question; Tenholt,<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">849</a> Goldmann,<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> and Dieminger<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">851</a>
recommend washing out with freshly prepared lime water with the
addition of caustic soda; Calmette<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> and Manouriez<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> spraying with
salt water. Theoretically spraying with hot water or steam should be
done every now and again for the destruction of the larvÃ¦ (Looss<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">854</a>).
Personal prophylaxis is partially included in the general prophylaxis
in so far as it is a case of oral infection, but something more can be
done for the individual to avert the danger of cutaneous infection.
According to Manson<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">855</a> it is advisable in the tropics to cover the
naked hands and feet with green Barbados tar, and the tarred parts
thickly with flour; Fabre<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">856</a> recommends that miners who might come
in contact with infected water should anoint the unprotected parts
(hands and feet), as then the larvÃ¦ cannot penetrate the skin; this last
procedure can easily be carried out on account of its simplicity and
cheapness.</p>

<p>Among the usual remedies for the expulsion of ancylostomes
thymol certainly comes first, introduced by Bozzolo<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">857</a> and since
used by many other authors, partly with good and partly with less
good results. The day before the beginning of treatment one should
endeavour to procure a thorough evacuation of the bowels by means
of calomel (Lutz,<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">858</a> GrÃ¼nberger,<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> Smith<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">860</a>) or cascara sagrada (Mann<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">861</a>),
only fluid food should be taken the evening before, and on the day
of treatment thymol is given in a quantity of 6, 8, 10 or 15&nbsp;grm., in
single doses of 2&nbsp;grm. with one or two hoursâ interval, and some hours
after an aperient. As a rule, one day of this treatment is not enough.<span class="pagenum" title="686"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686"></a></span>
(Prowe<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">862</a>), but one is compelled to repeat it on two consecutive days,
or even oftener, with subsequent intervals of many days. Thymol is
either given in wafers, gelatine capsules or mixed with sugar. Caution
should be used in giving brandy at the same time or[sic] bodies which
dissolve thymol (oil, fat) and thereby considerably favour its absorption.
It has been shown in many cases from toxic phenomena
that thymol is by no means an indifferent drug; violent burning in
the stomach and alimentary canal, lowering of the temperature,
shortness of breath and feeble pulse, giddiness, delirium and fainting
have all been observed. Sandwith<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> and Thornhill,<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> as well as
Leichtenstern,<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> even record cases of death after the use of thymol;
4&nbsp;grm. thymol caused severe symptoms of poisoning in GrÃ¼nbergerâs<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">866</a>
case. The black colour of the urine (thymoluria) which so often sets
in after the first dose is quite harmless, and is no contra-indication
to the continuance of the cure. Now and again there are traces of
albumin in the urine, but it is very seldom there is any severe acute
inflammation of the kidneys. Thymol is contra-indicated in advanced
old age and in debility, also in cases with a tendency to vomiting, in
gastritis, dysentery, heart or kidney affections.</p>

<p>The combination recommended by Goldmann<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> under the name
of taeniol, already mentioned under the treatment of tapeworms, and
which consists of thymol, sebirol and salicylate, appears also to render
good service in the treatment of ancylostomiasis (Goldmann<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">868</a> and
Liermberger<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">869</a>).</p>

<p>A carbonate of thymol, thymotal, from which thymol separates off
in the intestine, is given three to four times a day, in doses of
3&nbsp;grm. per diem (children up to 1Â·0&nbsp;grm.) on four consecutive days,
and at the end of the treatment a purge (Pool,<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">870</a> Bauer<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">871</a>); Leonardi<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">872</a>
speaks well of thymol essence (4Â·0&nbsp;c.c. per diem) in an emulsion with
plenty of water.</p>

<p>The next drug for the expulsion of ancylostomes is extractum
filicis maris, which is to be employed as in tapeworm treatment, but
has not always had the desired result, whilst in such cases as resist
the fern extract, thymol attains the desired effect (Mann<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">873</a>), whilst the
reverse is frequently observed (GrÃ¼nberger<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">874</a>). Nagel<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">875</a> prescribes
extr. fil. 8 to 10&nbsp;grm., chloroform 10 to 15 drops, syr. sennÃ¦ 16&nbsp;grm.;
before taking, the glass must be placed in hot water, otherwise the<span class="pagenum" title="687"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687"></a></span>
contents will not pour freely. Zinn<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">876</a> prefers extract. filicis maris
(freshly prepared) to all other drugs. Warburg<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">877</a> considers the treatment
with extr. fil. to be all the more certain the more thoroughly the
preliminary treatment is carried out. Filmaron 0Â·7&nbsp;grm., thymol
5Â·0&nbsp;grm., chloroform 1Â·5&nbsp;grm., ol. ricini 20Â·0&nbsp;grm. gave good results
after being given two to three times (Nagel<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">878</a>). Opinions are divided
as to the combination of thymol and extractum filicis maris (Hynek,<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">879</a>
Stockman,<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">880</a> Boycott and Haldane,<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> Adams<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">882</a>). As regards other remedies,
eucalyptus oil is well spoken of by Philips<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> and Hermann<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">884</a>: ol. eucalypti
2Â·0&nbsp;grm., chloroform 3Â·0&nbsp;grm., ol. ricini 30Â·0&nbsp;grm., to be taken at one
time or in three separate doses in the morning (on the previous evening
a saline purgative). Neumann<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">885</a> recommends podophyllin, to be taken
twice on three consecutive days in doses of 0Â·035&nbsp;grm. Podophyllin
appears to produce quite a peculiar condition of the intestinal mucosa
which is very prejudicial to the Ancylostoma adhering to it. Bentley<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">886</a>
regards Î²-naphthol as the best drug; after previous examination of the
bowels he gives it two or three times at two-hourly intervals, in doses
up to 1Â·0&nbsp;grm. (<i>Vide</i> also the Appendix, p.&nbsp;754, for other drugs.)
For the treatment of the anÃ¦mia, which often persists very obstinately,
good and abundant food, iron and arsenic preparations, Levico water
(Goldmann,<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> Liermberger<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">888</a>) are suitable.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Ascaris lumbricoides</b> (Ascariasis).</p>

<p><i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> is one of the most frequent parasites that
occur in man, both in adults as well as in children; as a rule, indeed,
it most frequently infects children of medium age. The normal
situation is the small intestine; this, however, is frequently left, and
the Ascarides travel into the stomach, Åsophagus, pharynx, bronchi,
the nasal cavities and still other regions. It is a peculiarity of the
Ascarides that they are prone to glide into narrow canals; for example,
Clason<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">889</a> records that in the case of an idiot whose custom it was to
swallow glass beads, the Ascarides showed a predilection for sticking
in the beads and were passed in the fÃ¦ces. The disturbances which
Ascarides occasion in the intestine itself vary; isolated species do not<span class="pagenum" title="688"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688"></a></span>
give rise to any symptoms at all, whereas a large number may
eventually give rise to severe local symptoms, or those of a toxic or
reflex nature which have been discussed in the General Section.</p>

<p>Among the local symptoms are the following: loss of appetite,
excessive appetite, perverted sense of taste, fÅtid breath, sensitiveness
to pressure over the abdomen, colicky pains and irregularity of the
bowels. The appearance and state of health suffer; the patients,
children in especial frequency, become remarkably pale; their complexions
undergo rapid change, and rings of grey or bluish-brown are
seen about the eyes. Children may become so reduced by this rare
condition, enteritis verminosa, due to Ascarides in large numbers, that
suspicion of the existence of intestinal tuberculosis arises. Emaciation
to a skeleton, excessive meteorism, and evacuations of thin gruel-like
stools, sometimes blood-stained, are observed in these cases. Even in
the case of adults, chronic uncontrollable vomiting with severe
inanition due to the Ascarides has been observed. When the
Ascarides escape spontaneously <i>per anum</i>, they frequently cause an
exceedingly troublesome irritation in the anal region (pruritus ani).</p>

<p>The most disagreeable symptoms and those most dangerous to
life arise from the migrations of Ascarides when they invade the bile-ducts;
no inconsiderable number of cases of this kind are recorded
in the literature (summarized, up to the year 1901, in Sickâs<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">890</a> Dissertation).
Penetration <i>post mortem</i> (or shortly before death) of the
worms into the bile-ducts cannot be considered as a rarity; the laxity
of the muscular orifices easily allows of this invasion also in other
directions on the part of the parasite in its escape from the body of its
dead host. The occurrence of the worm in the biliary passages in the
living is to be regarded as still less frequent, but nevertheless often
enough according to the records in literature. Sick<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">891</a> was able to
collect as many as sixty-one such cases, to which he added two further
fresh cases from the TÃ¼bingen clinic, that is, from the material provided
by his father. In the year 1891 Borger<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">892</a> collected fifty-nine
cases relating to the invasion by <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> of the bile-ducts and
passages, and Dauernheimâs<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">893</a> Dissertation treats of this question as
well. A further case of Ascaris in the ductus choledochus (choledochotomy)
is recorded by Neugebauer.<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">894</a> In the case of Schupper<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">895</a>
(woman, aged 52), all the biliary passages were distended and filled
with fourteen living <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> (perhaps as they were living they had
not led to a septic infection of the biliary passages); in the case<span class="pagenum" title="689"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689"></a></span>
communicated by Schiller,<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">896</a> an Ascaris had gained access to the
biliary passages after an operation for cholelithiasis (with distension
of the gall-bladder and formation of a fistula); it had kept itself alive
here eighteen days and was extracted from the fistulous opening.
Epstein<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">897</a> confirms the correctness of the explanation of the mark of
strangulation in an Ascaris in Mertensâ<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> case (in a woman, aged 30,
there was first icterus, later ascites, anasarca, swelling of the liver,
then the discharge of two dead <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>, one of which exhibited a
constriction somewhat behind its centre; after that there was rapid
improvement in all the symptoms); in his case there was icterus in
consequence of closure of the ductus choledochus by an Ascaris.
After the discharge of the worm the symptoms persisted; one of the
<i>AscaridÃ¦</i> had a typical strangulation mark. From the observation
recorded by Vierordt<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">899</a> it follows that, without doubt, mature females
can penetrate into the liver and there deposit eggs; in addition, that
such eggs appear exceptionally to undergo segmentation. A unique
feature in this case consisted in the exclusive discharge of immature
worms almost regularly throughout an interval of nine weeks; this
cannot be explained from our present knowledge of the biology and
pathology of the <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>. These worms clearly make their way from
the intestine outwards, through the opening into the duodenum of
the common bile-duct, and unquestionably the fully developed
Ascarides, with the aid of their conical head end, are enabled gradually
to penetrate the wall of the ductus choledochus (Quincke<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">900</a>), and gain
access to the gall-bladder, the hepatic duct and its branches.</p>

<p>The changes in the biliary passages and the liver are, on the one
hand, the mechanical results of a partial or total obstruction to the
flow of the bile, and, on the other, of inflammatory processes. The
blocking of the common bile-duct and of the trunk of the hepatic
duct leads to the well-known symptoms of biliary engorgement;
protracted continuance of this condition has, as its sequela, general
distension of the whole biliary system and degenerative destruction
of the liver-cells. If the Ascaris is situated at some other part of the
biliary system, its presence causes a partial arrest of the flow of bile,
with the corresponding sequelÃ¦. Many Ascarides perish in the ductus
choledochus, and here and in the gall-bladder they may supply the
nucleus of a gall-stone; deeper in the liver this does not appear to
happen; the dead <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> here undergo a kind of maceration, disintegrate,
and may be completely absorbed; in many cases the worms<span class="pagenum" title="690"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690"></a></span>
continue to live for a very long time in the biliary passages. When
the worms infect the biliary passages through the invasion of intestinal
bacteria, liver abscesses arise (Dauernheim,<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">901</a> Saltykow<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">902</a>).
Leer<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">903</a> goes so far as to maintain that <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> may be the second
most frequent cause of liver abscesses. That Ascaris in the pancreas
may simulate liver abscess in a remarkable fashion is shown by
Vierordtâs<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">904</a> observation, which is quite unique, while <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> have
been found to occur in isolated instances in the excretory ducts of
the pancreas and in its branches, where they have remained living for
a long time.</p>

<p>It is no rare occurrence for <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>, in consequence of their
migration into the stomach, to be ejected by the act of vomiting, and
in such way to gain access into the upper air passages, or to find
their way during sleep into the nose or accessory sinuses (Mosler and
Peiper<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">905</a>) without giving rise to special symptoms. For example,
Troja<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">906</a> found in the frontal sinus of a cadaver a large coiled-up
Ascaris which occupied the whole cavity. Wrisberg<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">907</a> made the same
observation in the cadaver of a boy. Deschamps<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">908</a> and Fortessin<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">909</a>
mention an Ascaris being met with in the antrum of Highmore.
Observations of the discharge of living or dead Ascarides from the
nose are frequently recorded. To this class belongs the case
mentioned by Albrecht,<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">910</a> in which an Ascaris was removed from the
nose of a girl, aged 7; also the case recorded by Benievini,<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">911</a> from
the nose of one of whose friends a worm escaped; he had suffered
from the most violent headaches, fainting fits, dimness of vision and
vomiting; after the escape those untoward symptoms disappeared.
Similar records have been made by Forest,<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">912</a> Lanzoni,<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">913</a> Langelott,<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">914</a>

and Chiari.<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">922</a> A rarer case is that recorded by Haffner,<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">923</a> that of a<span class="pagenum" title="691"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691"></a></span>
child, aged 4, in whom an Ascaris reached the nasal cavity through
the act of vomiting, and from there it gained access through the
naso-lachrymal duct and the inferior lachrymal sac into the lower
punctum lachrymale, from which half of it protruded.</p>

<p>Among the rarer causes of the occurrence of strange bodies in the
pharynx and naso-pharyngeal cavity, Jurasz<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> mentions in the first
place vomiting, which may afford opportunity for the more solid
bodies of the stomach contents, and even parasites of the digestive
tract, especially <i>AscaridÃ¦</i>, to become firmly lodged in the pharyngeal
or naso-pharyngeal cavity. <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> may obtain access from the
naso-pharyngeal cavity to the middle ear by way of the Eustachian
tube, as has been observed by Reynolds<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">925</a> and WagenhÃ¤user<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">926</a>; in the
case recorded by Turnbull<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">927</a> (girl, aged 8, with pains in her ear) the
Ascaris apparently reached the external auditory meatus by the same
route.</p>

<p>The irritation of the larynx and air passages by <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> is far
more dangerous than their penetration into the nose and naso-pharyngeal
cavity, because not only are attacks of suffocation, but
sudden suffocation thereby induced. Oesterlein<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">928</a> records a fatal
attack of choking from <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> in the trachea. In a case recorded
by Smyly<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">929</a> of a boy, aged <span class="nowrap">3â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2,</span></span></span> tracheotomy for extreme asphyxia was
performed without relief. At the <i>post-mortem</i> the cause of the asphyxia
was found to be an Ascaris in the trachea. FÃ¼rst<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">930</a> collected twenty-five
observations of invasion of the larynx and trachea by Ascaris.
Mosler<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">931</a> reports the case of a patient with aphonia and dyspnÅa
from whose larynx an Ascaris was removed. Donati<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">932</a> reports a case
of four Ascarides in the larynx, and Cerchez<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">933</a> of asphyxia from
Ascarides in the larynx or trachea. Wagner<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">934</a> records the case of
a boy, aged 8, in whom a coil of worms was ejected from the stomach
by vomiting; the mass blocked the entrance to the larynx and led to
death from suffocation. A case similar to that recorded by Smyly is
communicated by Rabot<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">935</a>; it was that of a child who underwent
tracheotomy for diphtheria, and who was not relieved by the operation;
when, however, an Ascaris appeared in the cannula and the
parasite was removed the child breathed well. In Negrescoâs<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">936</a> case,
that of a boy, aged 3, an Ascaris gained access to the larynx and from
there into the trachea, and a fatal issue from asphyxia resulted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="692"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692"></a></span></p>

<p>The route by which <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> obtain access to the urinary passages
must remain undecided. SchlÃ¼ter<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">937</a> treated a woman, aged 60, with
retention of urine. Upon catheterization the hinder end of an
Ascaris hung out from the catheter opening; the anterior end was
fixed in the tube and the lumen was obstructed. Perhaps in the
female sex <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> travel from the gut into the vulva and from there
into the bladder, as they have already been observed in the vagina,
where they cause troublesome symptoms (pruritus pudendi).</p>

<p>The diagnosis of ascariasis is not in general difficult; now and
then the worms are discharged spontaneously; if not, the ova, which
cannot be mistaken, can easily be detected in the fÃ¦ces upon microscopical
examination. Epsteinâs<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">938</a> method&mdash;namely, on every occasion
to obtain fresh material for examination&mdash;is much to be recommended.
This consists in introducing a Nelatonâs catheter into the rectum with
a rotatory motion and then drawing it out. A small portion of fÃ¦ces
forced into the catheter opening is more than sufficient to demonstrate
the presence of ova of the parasites upon microscopical
examination of a preparation.</p>

<p>In spite of all pressure on the part of relatives, treatment directly
against <i>AscaridÃ¦</i> should not be carried out until the diagnosis is
certain.</p>

<p>As regards prophylaxis, much can be done by not throwing the
worms, when expelled, on to the dung-hill or into the privy, but
straightway into the fire. Metschnikoff<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">939</a> has issued a warning
against the consumption of unboiled or badly washed vegetables,
salad, strawberries, etc., and also against drinking polluted water.</p>

<p>For the expulsion of the worms flores cinÃ¦ were formerly considered
the most useful means; now, however, santonic lactone&mdash;santonin&mdash;which
is prepared from them, is almost universally
preferred. By many, especially in practising among children, flores
cinÃ¦ are still recommended in the form of StÃ¶rkâs worm electuary
(consisting of flores cinÃ¦, rad. jalapÃ¦, valerian and oxymel simplex).
Guermonprez<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">940</a> recommends them because he thinks that santonin
only excites the worms and consequently causes unpleasant symptoms.
Besides, in the form of the above-mentioned electuary, flores
cinÃ¦ can also be given several times daily with raspberry jelly up to
0Â·5&nbsp;grm. to 2&nbsp;grm. (children and adults).</p>

<p>Santonin is prescribed either in single doses from 0Â·03 to 0Â·05 to
0Â·1&nbsp;grm. with sugar in the form of powder, or else in oily solution.
When given in the latter form the absorption of the santonin in the<span class="pagenum" title="693"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693"></a></span>
stomach is excluded and the whole quantity introduced is thus
enabled to reach the worms in the intestinal canal. KÃ¼chenmeister<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">941</a>
has already recommended combination of santonin with ol. ricini.
Lewin,<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">942</a> however, states that ol. morrhuÃ¦, ol. olivarum, ol. cocos
and ol. cinÃ¦ can also be taken. In prescribing santonin in oily solution
Henoch<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">943</a> also prefers the combination with ol. ricini. According
to Lewinâs direction the prescription would run as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>As santonin causes slight toxic symptoms such as urticaria,
vomiting, retention of urine, headache, vertigo, yellow vision
(xanthopsia), it is in every case advisable to follow with a laxative to
expel the drug from the body as speedily as possible. The urine
is coloured yellow from one to two days and assumes a scarlet
red colour upon the addition of alkalis; this, however, soon
disappears, while it persists in the case of rhubarb and senna.</p>

American worm-seed oil, derived from a plant native to the United
States, <i>Chenopodium anthelminticum</i>, Gray. It is given in emulsion
(ol. chenopodii anthelm. 10Â·0&nbsp;grm., vitelli ovi unius, ol. amygd., gi.

to 0Â·5&nbsp;grm. three times daily at one to two-hourly intervals, or as a pure
oil from 8 to 15 drops in sugar and water; to be followed an hour
after the last dose by oleum ricini or pulvis curellÃ¦. If no action
takes place by the afternoon, a laxative should again be given. The
treatment frequently must be repeated the next day. Thelen<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">952</a> appears
to have had good results from this drug.</p>

<p>Corsican moss (mousse de Corse), kamala, <i>Artemisia absinthium</i>,
valerian, semen sabadillÃ¦, have all been supplanted by santonin and
at most are used as adjuvants for the latter.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Oxyuris vermicularis</b> (Oxyuriasis).</p>

<p><i>OxyuridÃ¦</i> do not remain at rest in the gut, but leave it, generally
at night time, to migrate around the anus, into the gluteal folds, and
in females into the vulva and vagina and still higher up, giving rise
in these different sites to a whole series of irritative symptoms. In the
rectum, also, <i>OxyuridÃ¦</i> give rise to such symptoms, which are manifested
in the form of catarrhal inflammation; numerous chronic
intestinal catarrhs are thus explained. The frequent coincidence of
hÃ¦morrhoidal troubles with <i>OxyuridÃ¦</i> may be attributed to the fact
that the veins of the rectum participate in those changes which have<span class="pagenum" title="695"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695"></a></span>
been described as occurring in the intestinal mucosa. <i>OxyuridÃ¦</i>
may also give rise to prolapse of the anus, either by the tenesmus
they bring about having such a prolapse as its direct sequel, or the
proctitis that supervenes constituting a further etiological factor for
its occurrence (Ungar<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">953</a>). Anal fistulÃ¦ which still further increase
the trouble, and even rectal fistulÃ¦, appear to be capable of onset in
consequence of the irritation of the mucosa brought about by <i>OxyuridÃ¦</i>
(Trendelenburg<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">954</a>). The conditions recorded by von Wagener<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">955</a>
and Ruffer<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">956</a> appear to be of interest. At the <i>post-mortem</i> on a child,
aged 5, the former found fifteen to twenty quite minute nodules on
some Peyerâs patches, and in several of these <i>OxyuridÃ¦</i> were found
upon microscopical examination between the calcareous concretions
within the patches. He presumes that the parasites penetrated the
follicular ulcers, and after healing of the latter that they died and
became calcified. In the case of a man who died from cirrhosis
of the liver, Ruffer found in the rectum, at a distance of about 6&nbsp;in.
from the anal orifice, several tumours covered by the intestinal
mucosa, the smallest of which was the size of a pinâs head and the
largest that of a walnut. The tumours looked like calculi overgrown
by connective tissue; under the microscope, countless <i>OxyuridÃ¦</i> ova
were found in their interior.</p>

<p>The symptoms of irritation set up by these migrations from the
intestine are troublesome to the last degree; the pruritus thereby
induced is often unendurable; as this irritation from itching comes
on with especial severity during the night, the nightâs rest is grievously
interfered with; many attacks of night terrors appear to be occasioned
by these worms. But the general condition suffers as well; the
children become pallid and affected with nervous excitability.
Through the act of scratching the irritated parts the ova of the
parasites may be conveyed by contaminated fingers directly into the
oral or nasal cavities, certainly also into the oral cavity by the
contamination of food (auto-infection). In the case of boys the
sexual organs may be excited sympathetically through irritation of
the sacral nerves of the rectum; girls may be induced to practise
onanism in consequence of the entrance of the worms into the vulva.</p>

<p>As a result of the itching irritation which the scratching gives rise
to, and of the irritation due to the parasites migrating to the area
surrounding the anus, congestion and inflammatory symptoms may
arise in the peri-anal and perineal regions (weeping eczema, Seifert),<span class="pagenum" title="696"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696"></a></span><a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">957</a>
and these do not abate till after the removal of the oxyuriasis. Some
authors speak of an oxyuriasis cutanea (Majochi<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">958</a>), in the more
limited sense of a dermatitis intertriginoides. So far five such cases
have been recorded, one each by Szerlecky,<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">959</a> Michelson,<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">960</a> Majochi,<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">961</a>
Barbagallo<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">962</a> and Vignolo-Lutati.<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">963</a> Szerleckyâs case was that of
a young woman with intertrigo over the thighs (the skin was covered
as if with leather); Michelsonâs case was that of a boy, aged 13,
with intertrigo on the skin of the genito-crural fold, of the scrotum
and of the thigh; Majochiâs was that of a man, aged 38, with the
same localization; Barbagalloâs case was that of a boy, aged 14,
in whom the dermatitis extended to the hypogastrium (rhagades on
the scrotum); and Vignolo-Lutatiâs case was that of a man, aged 24,
with intertrigo of the peri-anal and perineal region, of the scrotum
and the inner side of the thigh.</p>

<p>On leaving the gut, <i>OxyuridÃ¦</i> frequently migrate to the stomach,
to the Åsophagus, to the mouth, to the nasopharyngeal cavity, and
into the nose (Zarniko<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">964</a>) (the localization in the nose has been
referred to as associated with the possibility of auto-infection&mdash;<i>see</i>
p. 695 as to the development of embryos from the ova in the
moist nasal mucosa). Still the occurrence of <i>OxyuridÃ¦</i> in the nose
is among the greatest of rarities. Chiari<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">965</a> records the case of a girl,
aged 14, who suffered from pains at the root of the nose and in
the left side of the forehead; female specimens of <i>Oxyuris vermicularis</i>
were evacuated from her nose on several occasions. A similar case
is recorded by Hartmann<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">966</a>; it was that of a girl, aged 13, with
epileptiform convulsions and psychic disturbances; numerous
Oxyurides frequently escaped from her nose. With their departure
the symptoms of irritation of the central nervous system also disappeared.
Rheins<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">967</a> records a case, that of a woman, in which a
specimen of <i>Oxyuris vermicularis</i> was discharged from the right
nostril during the act of sneezing. Proskauer<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> found in the nose
of a woman, aged 30, a conglomerate of from fifteen to twenty very
small worms which proved to be Oxyuris embryos.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of oxyuriasis is not difficult to make, as the troublesome
sensations in the anus and about the genitals necessarily suggest
the presence of <i>OxyuridÃ¦.</i> As a rule the small white worms are<span class="pagenum" title="697"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697"></a></span>
seen crawling about over recently evacuated fÃ¦ces, or the ova are
found upon microscopical examination of soiled matter adhering to
the anus, or in scrapings removed with the spatula from the surface
of the skin (in the case of oxyuriasis cutanea).</p>

<p>Prophylaxis has to be directed to infection with Oxyurides
generally, on the one hand, and, on the other, to the possibility of
auto-infection. With reference to the first-mentioned point, Metschnikoffâs<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">969</a>
directions should be borne in mind, to the effect that badly
washed vegetables, salad, etc., ought not to be eaten (vegetables to be
rinsed with boiling water), and also that the members of the family
of the diseased individual should be examined for <i>OxyuridÃ¦</i> and
eventually be treated (Heller<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">970</a>). With regard to the second point,
one has to observe strict cleanliness in general (Barbagallo<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">971</a> found
ova of the parasites in the layer of dirt under the finger-nails).</p>

<p>Treatment of oxyuriasis must be of a twofold nature; first,
medicinal, the administration <i>per os</i> of vermicidal drugs in combination
with purgatives; and secondly, local treatment of the gut by
means of enemata, suppositories and high injections. Following
the method prescribed by Ungar,<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> pulv. glycyrrhizÃ¦ co. is first given
in the case of smaller children, castor oil or calomel in that of those
older, in order to evacuate the intestine, and four times daily on two
days following one another a dose of naphthalin, not directly after
meal-time, but as far as possible in the interval between two meals,
and at the same time the ingestion of fatty or oily nutriment is as
far as possible to be avoided. After eight days this treatment should
be repeated, and under certain circumstances once again after
a further interval of a fortnight. The dose varies between 0Â·05 and
0Â·1&nbsp;grm. (children of 1 year old), 0Â·1 to 0Â·2&nbsp;grm. (children of 2 to 3 years
old) and 0Â·2 to 0Â·4&nbsp;grm. (children of 4 to 10 years old). DornblÃ¼th<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">973</a>
employs the same medicament in a form only slightly modified from
Ungarâs method, Barbagallo<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> gives internally only a purgative (decoct.
sennÃ¦ cum natr. sulfur). Thymol, santonin, kousso, kamala or valerian
may be tried instead of naphthalin. For enemata the following are
employed: naphthalin in a solution of 1 in 50, ol. olivar. or thymol
0Â·1 in 200 aq. destill., diluted solutions of lysol, menthol in <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> per cent.
oily solution, salicylate of soda in watery solution, decoctum
tannaceti with santonin, with the addition of some drops of ol.
terebinth. (Barbagallo). Decoctions of garlic, infusion of valerian,
sulphur water (sublimate is to be avoided), aq. calcariÃ¦, ol. olivarum<span class="pagenum" title="698"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698"></a></span>
camphoratum (Vignolo-Lutati). Santonin 0Â·1&nbsp;grm. is the best to
employ for suppositories.</p>

<p>For high injections, large quantities of plain water are employed
(2 to 4 litres), or soapy water (0Â·2 to 0Â·5 per cent. solution of sapo
medicatus, Heller,<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">975</a> Still<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">976</a>), <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> per cent. salicylic acid solution or liq.
alum. acet. (one tablespoonful to a litre of water, DornblÃ¼th<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">977</a>), or
gujanosol (2 to 3 to 4 to 5 per cent. solution, Rahn<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">978</a>). The employment
of benzine for such high injections is not advisable according to
the experience of Senger,<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">979</a> owing to the symptoms of poisoning after
the external application of benzine, at least not in the case of young
children.</p>

<p>That diseases of the intestine which are accompanied by frequent
thin fluid evacuations may lead to recovery from oxyuriasis has
frequently been observed by us in the case of young children who
have suffered from dysentery (Seifert<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">980</a>). Inunctions of cod-liver oil
appear to be very valuable in the treatment of oxyuriasis (Szerlecky,
Vignolo-Lutati), whilst those with mercurial ointment may easily
increase the inflammatory symptoms. The luxury recommended
by Esser,<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">981</a> that patients every evening before going to sleep should
have the female <i>OxyuridÃ¦</i> picked from the anal fold in the knee-elbow
position is one which is certainly only in the power of a few
people to carry into execution.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An essay has been published by Hippius and Lewinson (<i>Deutsch. med. Wochenschr.</i>,
1907, xliii.) in which the relationship of <i>OxyuridÃ¦</i> to appendicitis is considered and the treatment
of oxyuriasis is discussed. The instructive case recorded appears to show that germs
through <i>OxyuridÃ¦</i> gain access to the tissue of the appendix, and, indeed, are carried in by
them. In view of this more recent communication as to the part which intestinal parasites
play in the etiology of appendicitis, it seemed to me [O.&nbsp;S.] to be worth while to interrogate my
surgical colleagues as to this point. About 2,000 appendicectomies have been jointly performed
by Drs. Burkhardt, Enderlen, Pretzfelder, Riedinger, Rosenberger and Siber, and in
not one of these cases could entozoa be found to be a possible cause of the appendicitis.
Such figures without doubt speak in favour of the fact that even if in <i>individual</i> cases entozoa
might come into reckoning as a possible cause, such an etiological factor must be classed
among the greatest of rarities. My colleague, Dr. Ries, who practised for ten years in Mexico,
informed me that there practically speaking every Indian without exception harboured parasites
of the most varied kind, and that in spite of the very extensive professional standing he
enjoyed among these people he never had under observation among them a single case of
appendicitis. As far as the observation of the authors in question as to the treatment of
oxyuriasis is concerned, it must be energetically directed to the employment of local measures
for the intestine; they maintain that the use of enemata would be irrational, and that it is
astonishing that this method has been able to maintain its standing down to the present day.</p></div>

<h3><b>HIRUDINEI</b> <span class="fs80">(Leeches).</span></h3>


<p>The only one of the leeches that comes under consideration from
the clinical point of view is <i>Limnatis nilotica</i> (<i>HÃ¦mopsis sanguisuga</i>),
which obtains access to the mouth with drinking water, and becomes
lodged, even in the case of man, in the pharynx, larynx, trachea,
Åsophagus and nose.</p>

<p>Amongst the causes of severe hÃ¦morrhage from the pharynx
Jurasz<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">982</a> mentions the occurrence of leeches in that region: in
Northern Europe this must be accounted one of the greatest of rarities,
whilst at all times in southern countries, such as South Italy, Spain,
Greece, Algiers, Tunis and Egypt, it appears to have been more
frequent. Even the physicians of antiquity had much to say about
it. Upon the occurrence of blood-stained expectoration, Hippocrates
recommends the oral cavity to be examined to see whether a leech
is not present in it. Galen speaks of hÃ¦matemesis due to the presence
of leeches in the pharynx and stomach. Similar mention is found
in the writings of Celsus, Asclepiades, Scribonius Largus, Dioscorides,
AÃ«tius, Oribasius, Paulus Aegineta and others. In recent times,
Cortial<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">983</a> has published observations relating to this subject which
he had the opportunity of making in Constantine. Palazzolo<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">984</a>
also in Sicily found leeches in two cases in the pharynx, in one case
on the posterior wall, in the other in the crypt over the left tonsil.
According to Roset,<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">985</a> leeches adhere by preference behind the uvula,
simulating hÃ¦matemesis and hÃ¦moptysis, and the persistent hÃ¦morrhages
they give rise to may lead to severe anÃ¦mia. Leeches are found
in still greater frequency in the larynx than in the pharyngeal cavity.
Huber<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">986</a> records several observations of this kind in his historical
and therapeutical study. In the case of a man, aged 64, Ramon
de la Sota y Lastra<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">987</a> observed a leech on the nodulus epiglottidis;
this was removed with the forceps. In the case recorded by
Photiades,<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">988</a> a leech had remained adherent to the vocal cord for
more than twenty-two days. Maissurianz<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">989</a> records two such cases:
in one the leech had remained in the sinus morgagni for three weeks,
in the other in the same place for ten days. The case recorded by<span class="pagenum" title="700"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700"></a></span>
Schmolitschew<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">990</a> is an interesting one; it was that of a woman who
for four days had suffered from violent hÃ¦moptysis, the cause of
which was a leech that was fixed on the laryngeal wall of the epiglottis
close above the vocal cords. In his case (that of a soldier), Godet<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">991</a>
was forced to perform thyrotomy to remove the leech from the larynx.
Ficano<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">992</a> removed a live leech with the forceps from the lower
laryngeal cavity in a man, aged 30. Massei<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">993</a> reports a similar case.
The case reported by Winternitz and Karbinski<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">994</a> was that of a
peasant girl, aged 16, who suffered from coughing, hoarseness, and
blood-stained expectoration; a leech had lodged on the root of the
epiglottis. Aubert<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">995</a> removed a leech from the larynx of a woman
after the performance of tracheotomy. Seifert<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">996</a> reports three cases:
in the first the leech had become fixed to the left vocal cord, in the
second it was found in the lower laryngeal cavity, and in the third
on the border of the left ligamentum aryepiglotticum. Leone<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> has
published the case of a leech in the larynx, Martin<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">998</a> two cases with
the leech lodged in the lower laryngeal cavity, Berthoud<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">999</a> a similar
case, Palazzolo<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a> two such cases, Panzat<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a> one case (lower laryngeal
cavity). Moucharinski<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a> reports a case in which the leech had stayed
more than twenty days in the larynx. Martin<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a> easily removed a
leech from the posterior portion of the vocal cord with the forceps.
Vieus and Nepeon<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a> record a case of a leech in the larynx. It is
quite exceptional for leeches to gain access to the trachea; cases of
this kind have been recorded by Aubert,<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a> Vicano,<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a> Ridola<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a> and
Tapin<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a> (the leech was firmly fixed to the bifurcation and caused
coughing, hÃ¦moptysis and attacks of asphyxia; it was easily removed
by the aid of a tracheal tube). Now and then leeches are found in
the nose.</p>

<p>Lusitanus<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a> relates the case of a man who suffered from severe
headaches. A medical man ordered the application of a leech to the
anterior portion of the nostril. Owing to the carelessness of the<span class="pagenum" title="701"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701"></a></span>
surgeon the leech crawled right into the nose; it was impossible to
extract the leech or to kill it, and it produced a severe hÃ¦morrhage
which led to the death of the patient within two days. In a case recorded
by Sinclair,<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a> a leech, <i>HÃ¦mopsis sanguisuga</i>, gained access to the nose
of a boy, aged 3; it remained there a fortnight; it caused frequent
attacks of epistaxis and in the end it was removed by means of
forceps. Condorelli-Francaviglia<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a> records a case in which severe
epistaxis was caused by a leech which had probably entered the
anterior portion of the left nostril by way of the pharynx and become
tightly fixed there. It was seen by posterior rhinoscopy, and
was removed from in front by means of slightly curved forceps.
Sota y Lastra<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a> mentions the occurrence of leeches in the nose, and
Keng<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a> reports the case of nasal obstruction from a leech. The
removal of leeches is effected by means of injections or by the direct
sprinkling of salt or acid solutions on their bodies, which brings about
their detachment. When possible a previous attempt should be made
to seize them with forceps so as to make their immediate extraction
possible. The species of HÃ¦madipsa (Looss<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a>) live in tropical regions
in moist places on the ground or in the jungle. They climb bushes
and even trees with astonishing rapidity upon the approach of larger
animals and also of man (whom they clearly recognize from the
vibration of the ground caused by footsteps). From thence they let
themselves fall on their victims to suck their blood. Their bites are
generally painless, and of themselves not dangerous, but if they are
unusually numerous they rapidly accumulate on the body in large
numbers and give rise to marked debility and, if the wound become
infected, to severe complications and even death. On the other hand,
under careful treatment the wounds heal easily and fairly rapidly.</p>

<p>Firm leather and firmly adhering clothes afford no certain protection
against the attacks of these leeches, as they know how to
force themselves with extraordinary rapidity through the narrowest
interstices between the clothes and thus gain access to the skin.
When they have sucked their fill&mdash;and this may take several hours to
accomplish&mdash;they fall off of themselves. To effect an earlier removal
drops of irritative or corrosive fluids are employed (salt solutions,
acids, etc.). Tearing away the leech by force should be avoided,
as in this way portions of the leechâs body may be left behind in the
wound and inflammation be set up.</p>

<p>In the hot season of the year, that is, during the months of July
and August, it is noticed that those people who stray amongst
syringa bushes or who pick gooseberries or kidney beans are
attacked by the <i>Leptus autumnalis</i>. On the uncovered parts of the
body there appear numerous red spots and papules, which itch and
burn smartly. The itching does not commence diffusely, as in the
case of scabies (MacLennars<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a>), but is limited to the particular
points where the parasite is situated. There are especial outbreaks
of itching in the morning, arising perhaps from the hatching of ova
in the host after lying in the warmth of the bed.<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a> Leptus frequently
provokes general erythema, eczematization or severe feverish
urticaria, which in France is known by the name of fiÃ¨vre de grain
(MÃ©gnieu, Besnier<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a>). If the individual efflorescences be carefully
examined, there will be noticed almost without exception a minute
boss towards the centre, noticeable by its yellowish-red colour. If
an attempt is made to remove it with the point of a needle or to
scrape it off the surface, one can often perceive, even with the naked
eye, a small reddish creature moving actively about. The treatment
of these very troublesome symptoms consists in warm baths with
soapy lavages, also lavages with alcohol, spirit salmiac (G.&nbsp;P.), 5 per
cent. carbol or creolin solution, diluted vinegar, benzine, emulsions of
balsam of Peru, rubbing in sulphur ointment (Sandwith<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a>); ointments
of creosote or eucalyptus are recommended. Other grass and grain
mites also occasionally penetrate the skin of man and produce transitory
but sometimes very severe eruptions, urticaria and eczema
papulosum, as Geber<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a> and subsequent to him Josai<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a> have reported
of the barley mite. In sensitive individuals the skin becomes bright
red, to a greater or less extent their temperature is raised and frequently
slight febrile affections are present. If the inflammatory<span class="pagenum" title="703"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703"></a></span>
skin symptoms have reached their culminating point after three or
four days and no fresh complications arise, they only remain for
a short while, the effects of scratching and pigment spots being
left.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Kedani, Akaneesch</b> (The Japanese River or Inundation Disease).</p>

<p>This disease is only known in Japan, and is limited to the
neighbourhood of some great rivers on the west coast. The people
mostly attacked are those who cut the hemp harvest in the infected
localities, occasionally those who transport it or come into contact
with it (Looss<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a>). The disease is frequently manifested in the form
of indefinite disturbances of the general condition; it commences
generally on the sixth day after the presumed infection with rigors,
headaches, feeling of weakness, swelling of the lymphatic glands in
the loin or in the arm-pits; in the periphery a black dry scab is
formed. In addition there is an intense conjunctivitis, and added
to symptoms of fever an exanthema resembling measles that lasts
from four to seven days. There is frequent delirium and difficulty
of hearing which persist for a long while. Obstinate constipation is
a striking symptom. At the end of a fortnight, earlier in slighter
cases, the fever commences to abate and a rapid convalescence sets
in. In pregnant women abortion with fatal issue is frequent. With
regard to prophylaxis, Baelz<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a> recommends as rapid a cultivation of
the soil as possible, which has led to a speedy disappearance of
the disease in districts where it was once dreaded. Treatment is
symptomatic. Japanese do not tolerate antipyretic drugs as well
as Europeans.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Dermanyssus gallinÃ¦ (avium).</b></p>

<p>During the day the resort of bird mites is in the droppings and
in the woodwork, etc., of cages in which canaries, crossbills and
parrots are kept; in the crevices of doors, in the chinks between
the board planks of bedsteads, so that at night they may seek some
domestic animal to suck the blood and so satisfy their hunger. It
is by no means rare for young animals, chickens and unfledged
pigeons, etc., to perish in consequence of the great loss of blood.
This nocturnal habit of life explains why no mites can be found
during the day in spite of the most careful examination of the human
body, to which they may be transmitted. On the uncovered parts
of the body they not only cause severe irritation, but also severe
diffuse itching erythema and eczema. Thorough disinfection of the<span class="pagenum" title="704"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704"></a></span>
cages by hot solution of caustic potash, in addition, sprinkling over
with tar, red carbolic acid or petroleum, thoroughly powdering over
the birds with flores pyrethrÃ¦, washing with water containing oleum
anisi, washing the walls, doors and bedsteads with soap, disinfection
of the mattresses, linen and clothes, will protect against further
infection. In the case of man the disease needs no special treatment,
as the eruptions generally disappear after some days. Heinecke<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a>
recommends lavages with 1 per cent. carbolic acid solution. [<i>Vide</i>
also p.&nbsp;492 in body of this work.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

<p>[<i>Dermanyssus hirundinis</i>, Hermann, is identical with this species.
By far the best treatment is with paraffin or kerosene oil applied to
the places where they pass the day.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Ixodes reduvius (ricinus).</b></p>

<p>The female is occasionally transmitted to the human skin, and
bores its proboscis deep into it and sucks itself full of blood. At
sensitive points of the cutaneous surface&mdash;for example over the skin
of the penis&mdash;a feeling of severe pain is produced. Buyâs<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a> observations
as to the geographical distribution of the <i>IxodinÃ¦</i> show that in all
lands in which cattle, horses, sheep and dogs exist, <i>IxodinÃ¦</i> are to be
found. Recent observations show that the <i>IxodinÃ¦</i> play an important
part in the transmission of HÃ¦mosporidia (<i>vide</i> body of work,
pp. 493, 494). Sprinkling with oil, vaseline, benzine, ether, petroleum,
naphtha, turpentine (Jelgenum<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a>), will easily lead to the removal of
the parasite; if the body is torn away with violence and the proboscis
is left sticking in the skin, the presence of the latter will give rise to
inflammation and suppuration.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Sarcoptes scabiei</b> (Scabies).</p>

<p>The disease produced by <i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i> shows itself in polymorphous
areas, such as accompany eczema, and are produced on
the one hand by the Sarcoptes alone and on the other hand by
the scratching with the nails. The localization of both kinds of
efflorescences is different from those which are produced by the
Sarcoptes; they occur as papules, vesicles, pustules and mite-tracks,
and their usual situation is between the fingers, on the ulnar border
of the hand, on the wrist, on the palm of the hand, on the anterior
border of the axilla, on the penis and at the base of the thorax. The
excoriations are situated on the forearm, over the thigh, over the
abdomen, and may be distributed in greater or less degree over the<span class="pagenum" title="705"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705"></a></span>
whole body; the back and the face only remain free. The symptoms
consist in violent itching, the onset of which specially takes place
at night.</p>

<p>The mite-tracks are fine curving lines, curved like <b>a</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>c</b>, or <b>s</b>,
which appear as if they had been scratched with a fine needle. Upon
closer examination with the magnifying glass one sees in their course
small openings. These openings, in persons who keep themselves
clean, are scarcely coloured; but in patients whose occupations
necessitate their being associated with coloured or dirty substances,
they are dark. The length of the tracks varies from some millimetres to
<span class="nowrap">1â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> to 2&nbsp;cm. They are at the one end, where the Sarcoptes is embedded
in the epidermis, widened like a funnel and slightly exfoliated. The
track at this point is sharply defined; the mite shows through the
epidermis as a yellowish round point. In the course of the track there
develop papulÃ¦, vesicles or pustules, which raise the level of the track.
The intensity of these inflammatory appearances depends upon the
susceptibility of the human individual and upon the capability of
the reaction of the skin. There are people in whom scarcely
any inflammatory symptoms make their appearance; on the other
hand there are some, especially children and lymphatic individuals,
in whom severe impetiginous ecthymatous pustules, together with
their sequelÃ¦, are set up.</p>

<p>The results produced by scratching consist in papules, which
usually bear a small scab of blood, and are arranged in the form of
striÃ¦, in eczematous surfaces, weeping or sanguineous scabs, vesicles,
pustules, etc. The complications that set in are frequently urticaria
and even furuncles, lymphangitis and inflammation of the glands,
which now and then is followed by the formation of abscesses in the
glands.</p>

<p>The duration of the disease is unlimited; when untreated it leads
to a form of rare occurrence, that of scabies norvegica<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a>; in this the
collection of crusts and scales, in which a quantity of dead mites,
larvÃ¦ and ova are present, may become colossal.</p>

<p>The symptoms of scabies abate in the presence of intercurrent
acute diseases and reappear after the malady is over. The fact has
for long contributed to the idea of scabies being regarded as a disease
capable of being âdriven inâ upon the internal organs and forming
metastases.</p>

<p>The diagnosis is rendered certain upon the discovery of a track.
Traces of scratching on the extremities and on the abdomen, papular
or pustular efflorescences between the fingers, toes, in the neighbourhood
of the wrist, of the elbow, on the anterior border of the arm-pit,
on the tuber ischii, in the girdle region, and especially the presence of<span class="pagenum" title="706"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706"></a></span>
disintegrated tracts over the penis (prepuce and glans), will allow of
the diagnosis being made. Certain occupational eczemas (grocers,
lime-workers, maltsters, bakers and others), also prurigo, must be
borne in mind when diagnosing this disease.</p>

<p>The prognosis is always a favourable one. Even after such a
long duration and after such severe symptoms the disease may
completely clear up. There are, however, frequently left behind post-scabious
inflammatous and pruriginous conditions which only yield
after protracted treatment. Scabiophilia, which persists in certain
patients for a long time after the scabies has been cured, must here
be mentioned.</p>

<p>In the treatment of scabies four points must be kept in view.
(1) The mites and the ova must be killed by the treatment; (2) the
treatment must have regard to the intensity of the inflammatory
symptoms; (3) the clothes (body-linen) of the patients must be
disinfected; the bed-linen, the beds and the bedsteads must be
cleansed; (4) when a person suffers from scabies his entourage
must be examined, and all diseased conditions treated in the same
way as under (3).</p>

<p>The treatment (1) should be preceded by a bath with thorough
soap ablution, and when the inflammatory symptoms are not too
severe, with green soap. After the bath the skin is dried and the
scabies remedy proper applied in warmth. Sulphur preparations
receive first consideration; among such Vlemingkzâs mixture occupies
a prominent position; this is rubbed in for half an hour by means of
a strong camel-hair brush, to be followed by another bath and
powder applications after drying. Repeat this method for three days
one after the other, or for two days, and a third time eight days later.
The latter method is worthy of recommendation as the ova, which
perhaps resist the parasiticide action, have by this time developed into
larvÃ¦, and the latter can then be destroyed with certainty. The
remaining sulphur preparations, which are specially employed in the
form of ointments, are more complex, as the ointment should remain
on the skin. Helmerischâs and Wilkinsonâs ointments are the kinds
specially employed. Nagelschmidt<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a> recommends thiopinol as a very
suitable sulphur preparation in the form of baths or as a 10 or
5 per cent. ointment in the following way: Upon his reception the
patient is given a thiopinol bath, in which he remains for thirty
minutes. Immediately afterwards 30 to 40&nbsp;grm. 10 per cent. thiopinol
vaseline is carefully rubbed in. The rubbing is repeated daily, and
the treatment is concluded on the second to fourth day with a second
thiopinol bath. Thiopinol produces no more irritation than the
ordinary sulphur ointments; it is, however, much more penetrative
and more capable of absorption.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="707"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707"></a></span></p>
<p>We frequently make use of Kaposiâs naphthol ointment, as it
renders the skin supple, causes proportionately little irritation, and
has but little smell. Treatment with balsam of Peru is certainly
expensive, but in the slighter attacks it is relatively the simplest. We
give the patient a bath, have him thoroughly dried and rub in 30 to
40 to 50&nbsp;grm. balsam of Peru carefully and evenly all over, wrap
him in a covering of wool, and make him rest in bed for twelve to
fifteen hours, to be followed by a bath with careful cleansing with
soap; this treatment need rarely be repeated. The balsam of Peru
can be applied undiluted for the rubbings or mixed with ung.
glycerini, or resorbin or glycerine in equal parts. [Norman Walker
uses balsam of Peru <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&nbsp;oz. dissolved in rectified spirit; to be painted
on with a brush.]&mdash;J.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;S. The manufacturers name the undiluted
product of the active constituent of balsam of Peru, benzoic acid
benzyl-ester, Peruscabin. For the treatment of scabies it is recommended
by Sachs<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a> that it should only be administered when mixed
with ricinus oil, under the name of Peru oil, in applications repeated
three times within thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>Sack<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a> also considers Peru oil a non-irritant, effectual, pleasant,
inodorous and non-staining drug. But he only allows the applications
to be used every twelve hours for three to four consecutive days
(altogether 200 to 300&nbsp;grm. of Peru oil are requisite), and after the
sixth or seventh rubbing a bath should be taken with the use of
Dutch soap. Juliusberg<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> considers this treatment specially suited
for private practice. Another modern drug is epicarin ([Beta]-oxy-naphthyl-ortho-oxy-meta-tolyol
acid); this is applied in 10 to 20 per
cent. ointments (Pfeiffenberger<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a>), epicarin 7Â·0&nbsp;grm., cretÃ¦ alb. 2Â·0&nbsp;grm.,

upon the odourlessness and colourlessness of epicarin ointment as a
strong reason for its use, and points out that it is a harmless drug, the
action of which is certain. Endermol (salicylic acid ointment) has a
destructive action on the mites even in a 0Â·1 per cent. ointment
(Wolters,<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a> Demitsch<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a>); it is, however, very expensive and not wholly
free from danger; and the same applies to nicotiana soap (Taenzer,<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a>
Schumann<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="708"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708"></a></span></p>

<p>To give an account in detail of the drugs and methods&mdash;old and
new&mdash;used in the treatment of scabies would far outrun the limits of
this work.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Demodex folliculorum.</b></p>

<p>It is not yet certain whether the <i>Demodex folliculorum</i> is capable
of developing pathological conditions in man. Veiel<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a> assumes that
the hair follicle mite has no connection either with the formation
of comedones or even with sebaceous gland disease. Kaposi<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a> considers
that they cause no disease in man and cannot be regarded as
a cause of acne. Saalfeld<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a> clearly adheres to the same standpoint,
similarly so Jessner,<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a> who, when discussing comedones, makes no
mention of acne of hair follicle mites. Weyl<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a> and Geber<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">1046</a> adhere to
the opinion that the presence of a Demodex in man in contradistinction
to its presence in animals possesses absolutely no pathogenic
influence. On the other hand de Amicis,<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">1047</a> Majochi,<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a> and Dubreuilh<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a>
report single cases of pronounced circumscribed clear brown
pigmentations which they attribute to <i>Demodex folliculorum</i>. In all
these cases, moreover, as regards localization the affection had a
certain resemblance to pityriasis versicolor; nevertheless, in the scales
separated off with the scalpel no fungi were found, but on the other
hand Demodices in moderate quantity. In his earlier cases Majochi
has seen the Demodex in the secretion from meibomian glands and
had claimed it to be the excitant of chalazion and, as Mibelli<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a> did,
considered it to be the cause of some diseases of the eyelids. Ivers<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a>
found the parasite in 69 per cent. of normal borders of the eyelids,
and attributes a pathological signification to it. HÃ¼nsche<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a> and
Mulder<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a> arrive at the same conclusions; in the light of their investigations
the Demodex is found as a constant accessory&mdash;certainly not in
the meibomian glands, as it is limited only to the internal part of the
hair follicle. Lewandowsky<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a> considers that it can hardly be demonstrated
at present that the same parasite which in individual specimens
causes no symptoms is capable of producing pathological conditions
when markedly increased in numbers.</p>

<p>Treatment is by the removal of the comedones, above all, by their
mechanical removal by pressure with a watch-key and with the<span class="pagenum" title="709"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709"></a></span>
various comedo-compressors, and by subsequent cleansing of the
skin with ether, benzine or spirit. If the eyelids should be affected
with blepharitis due to the presence of Demodex in large numbers,
epilation and administration of a parasiticide is recommended.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Demodex folliculorum canis.</b></p>

<p>Transmission from dog to man is in any case very rare, and by
many its occurrence is generally doubted. Nevertheless Gruby<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a> and
Remak<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a> claim that it is transmissible&mdash;an opinion which has also
been shared by Neumann<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a> and ZÃ¼rn.<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a> The latter saw in the case
of a married couple who had the care of mangy dogs the onset of
diseased areas on their hands and feet, which were like those on the
dogs and contained the same parasites.</p>

<p>A. Babes<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a> also reports several observations which go to show
that persons who, to some extent, have been shown to have been in
contact with mange-stricken dogs have been attacked by a scabies-like
eruption localized over the thorax, abdomen, back and extremities;
large numbers of Demodices were found in the follicular
pustules. Lewandowsky<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a> reports one case&mdash;that of an Italian
workman, who suffered from an outbreak on the face, like impetigo;
there was crust formation and at the edge of the crusts the epidermis
appeared like a narrow row or border of vesicles. A small portion
of the covering of the row of vesicles was lifted off, and after slight
warming examined in 40 per cent. liquor potassÃ¦. In this a large
number of animal parasites of the Demodex group were found, and
without doubt <i>Demodex folliculorum canis</i> alone. HÃ¼nsche<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a> assumes
that <i>Demodex folliculorum</i> penetrates into the tissues and produces
abscesses.</p>

<p>Treatment first consisted in dusting with zinc amyl powder, but
after four days there was no change. After the regular use of xeroform
as a powder application, the affection cleared up within
fourteen days.</p>


<h3><b>INSECTA.</b></h3>

<p class="spec"><b>Pediculus capitis</b> (Pediculus capitis) (Head Louse).</p>

<p>We find <i>Pediculus capitis</i> in very young children and in others
more grown up to be the incessant and frequent cause of impetiginous
crust-forming eczemas. It is more frequent in girls than in<span class="pagenum" title="710"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710"></a></span>
boys. In families it is endemic, in schools epidemic, but it also
occurs in fair frequency in female adults (servant maids, waitresses)
who may pay little attention to bodily cleanliness. The puncture
of the parasites sets up a severe irritation, which leads to violent
scratching. The consequences of this are the formation of nodules
and pustules, crusts and âweepingâ patches; the hairs become felted
and the final clinical picture is that of plica polonica. The conditions
of irritation which are produced by these parasites and then by the
scratchings of the impetiginous, and frequently the very severe
suppurative processes of the hair-bed, lead to swellings in the neck
and sometimes even to glandular suppurations. The eczematous
processes not infrequently extend over the face, the neck and the
thorax. Blepharitis and conjunctivitis may be due to <i>Pediculus
capitis</i>.</p>

<p>The means of infection are often very remarkable. Transmission
from one individual to another certainly often occurs, but infection
may take place in railway carriages and in other ways. A case under
the observation of a colleague in Frankfort is a most remarkable one:
he diagnosed pediculosis as the cause of a head eczema occurring
among the children of one of the best families there. The infection
took place through dolls adorned with human hair, in which the
presence of nits could be demonstrated.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of <i>Pediculus capitis</i> is not difficult to make when
the hairs and hairy scalp are carefully examined for nits and living
parasites. In better families it is a good plan to point out the
<i>corpora delicti</i> to their possessors and to make them aware of the
possible sources of infection.</p>

<p>As regards treatment, lotions of sabadill vinegar are recommended;
in slighter cases these are quite sufficient. In severe cases
cure will not result unless dressings of petroleum, naphthol ointment
(5 to 10 per cent.) and balsam of Peru be applied. In the case of
plica polonica, the hair must be cut quite short (even in adults) so
as to control matting of the hair. To get rid of nits from hair that
is not matted, careful combing and washing with strongly alkaline
fluids or with hot vinegar is suitable.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Pediculus vestimenti</b> (Clothes Louse).</p>

<p>The clothes louse attacks adults by preference, and with especial
frequency old and emaciated persons. It lives in the clothes, but
derives its nourishment from the body. At the moment at which
the clothes louse inserts its proboscis into the skin the person experiences
a slight sting, which, however, at once ceases to hurt. If the
body of the louse is sucked full of blood it falls off and the individual<span class="pagenum" title="711"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711"></a></span>
has rest from it for a time. A wheal develops around the hÃ¦morrhagic
area of the bitten spot and itches severely. The itching goes
on until the eruption is scratched all over. This is followed by crust
formation. When many parasites are present the itching reflexes
become more severe, and the patients scratch themselves considerably
and make long marks at those places where the Pediculi have been.
The localization of the scratching effects is characteristic, corresponding
with folds between portions of clothing (regions between the
shoulder-blades, wrist and neck). If the condition lasts for a month,
the scratching effects extend over the whole body, and secondary
efflorescences become associated with it, such as pustules, ulcers and
eczemas. Intermediate between this we find cicatrices and pigmentation,
the latter under certain circumstances extending over the whole
body. Sulla, Herod, Cardinal Dupet, Philip II, and others are said
to have died from louse disease. That even at present many human
beings are exposed to the danger of being devoured by lice is a fact
that we have had the opportunity of observing on several occasions.
Only to record one instance, a man, aged 65, was received into our
clinic some time ago in an absolutely neglected condition (he had
been staying for some weeks in a stable, lying on a wretched bed).
The whole of the surface of his body was covered with countless
furuncles, of greater and less size, which had partly become changed
into undermined ulcers. Over the ulcers and beneath their undermined
edges Pediculi were swarming.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Phthirius inguinalis</b> (<i>Pediculus pubis</i>) (Crab Louse).</p>

<p>The transmission of these parasites generally takes place during
coitus, and therefore they especially occur in the pubes. It is possible
also that transmission is effected through dirty clothes and bed-linen
and privy seats.<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a> Starting from the pubes the animals crawl out over
the other parts of the body provided with hairs to the abdominal
wall and the thorax (so far as these parts are furnished with thick
hair) to the arm-pits, the beard, the eyebrows; not, however, to the
hair of the head, or rarely so; among our numerous cases we have
never met with an example of the crab louse attacking the hair of
the head.</p>

<p>The irritation produced by the crab louse is extraordinarily severe,
especially during the night, as the warmth of the bed incites the lice
to active sucking. In consequence of the violent scratching indulged<span class="pagenum" title="712"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712"></a></span>
in, eczemas are set up at the points attacked, and these often spread
to the neighbouring parts not covered with hair.</p>

<p>Of special interest is the onset of maculÃ¦ cÃ¦ruleÃ¦ (tÃ¢ches bleues)
in some persons affected with crab lice (people disposed to sweating
seem to be peculiarly liable to these). They consist in pale blue
patches of various size and shape, varying from that of a hemp-seed
to that of a lentil, and again to that of a nail in size and form. These
are found over the cutaneous surface of the abdomen, thorax and
thigh, and are often only seen by a good lateral illumination. Duguet<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a>
considers that the condition is a toxic erythema, that it is set up, on
the occasion of the bite of the parasite penetrating the skin, by the
poisonous substance derived from it. Oppenheim<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a> considers that it
is a colouring substance that is formed in the salivary glands of the
parasites, and which penetrates the skin when the insects bite, and
thus forms the maculÃ¦ cÃ¦ruleÃ¦. We have on several occasions
emulated the experiment of Duguet (trituration in a mortar of crab
lice freshly taken from the human body and inoculating the mass
thus obtained beneath the skin), and have similarly been enabled to
produce the maculÃ¦ cÃ¦ruleÃ¦ experimentally, but we have certainly
been unable to determine which of the hypotheses is the correct
one, the toxic erythema or the colouring substance inhibition
theory.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of phthirasis is very easy, for either the sexually
mature parasites or the nits are found on the hairs.</p>

<p>As regards treatment, grey ointment is regarded as a generally
useful application; it gives rise, however, to a slight eczema of the
genitals, especially in males, when injudiciously used. Geber<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a>
recommends petroleum or balsam of Peru, Oppenheim<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a> a 1 per cent.
sublimate solution for lotions, or a mixture of equal parts of petroleum
and benzine when the sublimate cannot be borne. The use of
a 5 per cent. ointment with hydrarg. oxid. flavum is worth considering
in treatment of pediculosis of the eyebrows and eyelashes. The
simplest method of treatment, and one with a radical effect, is that by
sulphuric ether recommended by Thomer.<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a> It certainly produces
a sharp burning sensation, but the living parasites and nits are
destroyed in one sitting. We prefer ether lotions as a rule, and we
thoroughly rub the affected parts with a pad of wadding well soaked
with the ether. The dead parasites and the nits fall on to what lies<span class="pagenum" title="713"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713"></a></span>
beneath when the rubbing is done thoroughly, and the burning sensation
caused by the ether only lasts a few minutes.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Cimex (Acanthia) lectularia</b><a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a> (<i>Cimex lectularius</i>) (Bed Bug).</p>

<p>The puncture in the skin made by the bed bug gives rise to an
extraordinary amount of severe itching and a burning sensation, and
when the skin is sensitive wheals of remarkable size (<i>urticaria ex
cimicibus</i>). These eruptions that cause such severe itching are
scratched by those attacked, till very soon blood begins to flow, and
this generally leads to the formation of a dried crust of blood at the
point of eruption.</p>

<p>The diagnosis is not always easy, as urticaria arising in other ways
frequently leads to similar vigorous scratching and formation of crusts
of dried blood. Men who have some experience in this matter (for
example, commercial travellers), when they are attacked by severe
itching at night, are in the habit of striking a light and searching in
their bed and body-linen for the bugs, in order to be able to hand
over the <i>corpora delicti</i> to the landlord if need be. The assumption
that the bugs in the East play an actual part in the propagation of
tuberculosis and bubonic plague has been proved by investigations
made by Nuttall<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a> to be at least very exaggerated if not wholly without
foundation. Further investigations may decide how far the bugs
participate in the transmission of kala-azar, as is believed by Rogers
to take place.</p>

<p>The bed bugs must be exterminated by spraying the chinks and
joints in the boards with petroleum and benzine, pulling up the
carpets and cleansing the bedsteads. For the treatment of the bite
itself the methods recommended as an antidote against insectsâ stings
in general are suitable: 2 per cent. carbol vaseline (Rosenbach<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a>),
thymol dissolved in spirit (1 in 50<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a>), Ã¦throl or deci-Ã¦throl, form-Ã¦throl
(manufactured by Dr. Nordlinger, FlÃ¶rsheim a. /M.), formol<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a>
(formol 15 parts, xylol 5 parts, acetone 44 parts, Canada balsam 1 part),
with the aid of a pad of wadding placed over the part bitten, lavages
with vinegar, citron juice and spirit of salmiac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="714"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714"></a></span></p>

<p class="spec"><b>Pulex irritans</b> (Human Flea).</p>

<p>The bite of the flea produces a slight discharge of blood about the
size of a pinâs head, which rapidly becomes surrounded with a circular
area similar to a patch of roseola. The redness fades away after
a longer or shorter while (several hours), whilst the discharge of blood
is to be seen for one or two days longer. In dirty people the whole
body may be covered with such discharges of blood. Individuals
with very delicate, sensitive skin, especially small children, show true
wheal formation at the site of the bite. In certain cases there
develops from one such single bite an urticaria that extends over
a large part of the body. The manner by which an irritating substance
is introduced into the skin upon biting by the bed bug and
also by the flea is clear. The bite is followed by a feeling of itching,
which is liable to rob nervous persons of their sleep. Sensitive
individuals are upset even by the fleas moving over the surface of the
skin during their rest at night.</p>

<p>Treatment consists in extreme cleanliness, capture of the parasites,
sprinkling the body and bed-linen with insect powders. The fleas
are difficult to remove from barracks, schools and hospitals.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Dermatophilus</b> (<b>Sarcopsylla</b>) <b>penetrans</b> (Sand Flea).</p>

<p>The fertilized females penetrate into the skin with their heads, and
here they swell, in consequence of the numerous and growing eggs
and larvÃ¦, to a white ball the size of a small pea, on which the head
is recognizable only as a small brown point.</p>

<p>In this way a small brown tumour arises, over which, at the
commencement, the skin is not reddened; after some days, however,
it becomes inflamed; in the centre of it a small opening is seen.
If the parasite is not extracted the skin that lies over it becomes
destroyed by suppuration, and thus becomes removed. At the
commencement the part affected itches, with increasing inflammation;
the symptoms of irritation become more severe and may amount
to actual pain. If the small suppurative processes be neglected,
inflammation and gangrenous and septic processes may arise. The
region of the body sought out by preference by the sand flea is
the sole of the foot, the toes, under the free ends of the nails and
the digito-plantoid folds&mdash;more rarely the scrotum, thigh and other
parts are attacked (Scheube<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a>). The number of parasites found on
one person may amount to several hundreds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="715"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715"></a></span></p>
<p>Treatment consists in the removal of the parasites from the skin
with a needle or a small sharp knife and the application of a bandage.
Rubbing the feet with copaiba or Peru balsam, sprinkling them with
insect powder, or washing them with bay rum (Berger<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a>) acts as a
prophylactic or removes the irritation of the skin produced by the
parasites.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Myiasis.</b></p>

<p>Under the name of myiasis we designate the complex symptoms
which parasitic dipterous larvÃ¦ give rise to in man (Braun), and we
conceive under the term myiasis externa (dermatosa s. cutanea) all
lesions of the human integument caused by fly larvÃ¦ and of the
cavities covered with mucosa therewith connected, such as the
external auditory meatus, the oro-nasal cavity, the urethra and vagina.
The occurrence of dipterous larvÃ¦ in the digestive tract is named
myiasis intestinalia or interna.</p>


<p class="spec"><b>Myiasis externa.</b></p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ of a species of fly belonging to the <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>, <i>Lucilia
macellaria</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a> are found in relative frequency in the nose, especially
in America and India.<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a> Riley<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a> has stated that the screw-worm of
Central America and of the United States is nothing else than the
larva of <i>Lucilia macellaria</i>, and also that the Brazilian fly named
âbernaâ may be no other than <i>Lucilia macellaria</i>. Their offspring
may set up inflammatory disturbances in the soft tissues of man. This
fly has a wide distribution, from the Argentine Republic to Canada,
also in the British portions of the East Indies, where the disease is
named âpeenash.â This word is derived from the Sanskrit, and is
said to be a collective name for all diseases of the nose. Lahory<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a>
states that within a period of nine years ninety-one cases of âpeenashâ
occurred in Allyghar, two of these ending fatally. <i>Lucilia macellaria</i>
is not at all timid but bold, like the house-flies and blue-bottles,
its relatives. It not only lives at no great distance from human
dwellings, and forces its way into villas and country houses, but even
attacks its victims without awaking them from their sleep. Although
this species shows a certain preference for nasal cavities affected with
catarrh or pus (v. Frantzius<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a>), and also the external auditory meatus,<span class="pagenum" title="716"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716"></a></span>
as well as ulcerated or wounded parts of the body, and even badly
ulcerated skin carcinoma (Lutz<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a>), it is not a rare thing for it to
penetrate into one of the above-mentioned cavities rapidly to deposit
its eggs, without these parts having been previously affected. The
report also of Conil,<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a> in which these flies bear the name of <i>Calliphora
anthropophaga</i><a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a> is an interesting one. Probably it was the same species
of Muscid in the cases of myiasis nasi observed by von Tengemann,
Delasiauve,<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a> Weber,<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a> Mankiewicz,<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a> and Kirschmann.<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a> In the case
recorded by Prima,<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a> and in that recorded by Britton,<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a> the issue was
a fatal one; in the latter the larvÃ¦ escaped through the pharynx
and nose; the hyoid bone and the soft parts of the palate were
destroyed, the speech and power of swallowing were hindered. At
the <i>post-mortem</i> extensive destruction of the internal nose was found,
so that the nasal bones could only be kept in their position by the
aid of the external skin. Even during life 227 larvÃ¦ escaped.
Similar destructive processes were found in the case communicated
by Richardson.<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a> In two cases reported by Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a> 300 and 350
larvÃ¦ were respectively removed from the nose, and the patients
recovered. Wolinz<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a> found his patient had lost consciousness, and
that in the pus filling up the entrances to the nose numerous larvÃ¦
were moving; recovery followed. In the case communicated by
Adler,<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a> more than 150 larvÃ¦ escaped from the nose of an old man.
Curran<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a> states that people suffering from âpeenashâ frequently die
from meningitis. The cases reported by Pierre<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a> related to the forms
of severe myiasis frequently to be observed in Guiana. In a patient
who was suffering from typhus (? typhoid), Douglas<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a> found the
conjunctival sacs full of larvÃ¦; in two other individuals the nasal
cavities were attacked.</p>

<p>The case observed by Summa<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a> was that of a man, aged 28, who
suffered from nasal obstruction, fÅtor, epistaxis and pain in the nose.
Out of seven of the cases occurring at Fort Clark, U.S.A., and in its<span class="pagenum" title="717"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717"></a></span>
neighbourhood, six ended fatally; in all these cases Kimball<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a> diagnosed
ozÃ¦na; attracted by the strong odour the flies forced their
way into the noses of the patients when asleep and there deposited
their ova. In a case reported by CarriÃ¨re<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a> an abscess of the nasal
septum was produced by the larvÃ¦ of flies; Chiodi<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a> reports seven
cases of myiasis due to <i>Lucilia macellaria</i>; among these was a case
of rhinitis myiatica, in which a cerebral abscess leading to a fatal
termination developed, being produced by the migration of a larva
into the brain. Among the three cases of Lesbini<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a> was that of a girl,
aged 16, with 250 larvÃ¦ in the diseased nasal cavity. Quintano<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a>
observed larvÃ¦ beneath the eyelids in one case. It is possible that
the cases of Cesare<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a> and Calamida<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a> were those of myiasis nasi due to
<i>Lucilia macellaria</i>. The larvÃ¦ are also found in the nasal accessory
sinuses, as is seen from the cases reported by De Saulle<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a> (frontal
sinus), Delasiauve<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a> (frontal sinus), MacGregor<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a> (antrum of Highmore),
and Bordenave<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a> (antrum of Highmore).</p>

<p>If a survey is made of the literature of the cases described of
myiasis nasi produced by <i>Lucilia macellaria</i><a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a> the following information
is forthcoming: In Europe this form of the disease is of very rare
occurrence, whilst in America and India<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a> it is frequent. Persons
suffering from ozÃ¦na are rendered the most liable to danger as the
penetrating odour entices the flies in tropical countries with intense
frequency, so much so that v. Frantzius does not consider this
myiasis as an independent disease, but as a complication of ozÃ¦na of
frequent occurrence in warm countries. The infection is so far
of interest in its nature, in that it only takes place during the day.
The fly is on the wing only by day when the sun is shining, and
consequently only deposits its eggs at this time. Therefore persons
suffering from ozÃ¦na are principally exposed to the danger of being
pursued by the flies when they succumb to sleep during the mid-day
hours in the open or in dwellings that are not closed up.</p>

<p>Headache is the symptom which most troubles the patients.
It extends over the whole cranium and persists uninterruptedly, with<span class="pagenum" title="718"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718"></a></span>
more or less severe periods. Violent headaches in the frontal and
buccal regions are almost always present in this complaint; they are
experienced either only on one side or on both simultaneously;
sometimes the pain is extended to the lower jaw and region of the
neck, following the whole extent of the trigeminal nerve. The
inflammation of the nasal mucosa produced by the penetration into
it of the larvÃ¦ extends right into the frontal sinus and antrum.
Simultaneously the patients, at the height of their trouble, suffer
from persistent sleeplessness and severe vertigo, so that they reel and
cannot walk straight; excessive sneezing always sets in at the commencement.
The larvÃ¦ immediately spread over the nasal mucosa to
seek a place suitable to feed, and irritate the nasal mucous membrane
by the tickling sensation they produce. Later the patients frequently
sneeze when the maggots move to and fro.</p>

<p>One very characteristic symptom consists in the peculiar swelling
of the face, which is extended either over the whole or only one half
of it, and may alternate with attacks of erysipelas (Brokaw<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a>).</p>

<p>The discharge from the nose is of special diagnostic value. It
consists of a blood-stained serous matter or blood-stained fluid,
which is perpetually trickling from one or both nostrils. The larvÃ¦
especially choose the anterior portions of the nasal cavity, where they
can be seen lying in groups together at the base of the choanÃ¦.
The consequence of this is that the soft palate becomes intensely
swollen, and this in turn makes swallowing very difficult; speech is
impeded, and the voice acquires a nasal intonation. Symptoms of
fever become more or less pronounced according to the number
of larvÃ¦ present, and according to the nature and constitution of the
individual. The appetite is in abeyance throughout the whole duration
of the illness, and sometimes there is the onset of slight attacks
of diarrhÅa.</p>

<p>If the larvÃ¦ are not removed in good time there follows excessive
destruction of the interior of the nose and of the turbinals; and the
whole nasal framework undergoes disintegration, frequently, too, the
velum palati, so that the larvÃ¦ come into sight in the oral cavity.
Individuals thus severely attacked succumb through exhaustion,
symptoms of meningitis (cerebral abscess) or septicÃ¦mia (Prima<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a>).
Twenty-one out of thirty-eight cases recorded (collected) by Maillard<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a>
died.</p>

<p>The method of prophylaxis is self-evident from what has been
stated. On bright summer days neither the healthy nor those suffering<span class="pagenum" title="719"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719"></a></span>
from diseases of the nose should sleep during the day-time in the
open or in public habitations; sufferers from nasal diseases should
pay special attention to this.</p>

<p>Treatment consists in the removal of the larvÃ¦; this, however, is
not always easy.</p>

<p>With regard to the methods which have proved to be effectual in
the destruction of living larvÃ¦ and their expulsion from the nose,
strongly smelling and easily diluted fluids come first, such as alcohol,
eau-de-Cologne, and ether, which should kill the creatures when
injected into the nostrils. The earlier physicians, such as Salzmann,<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a>
Honold,<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a> and Henkel,<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a> have seen good results from the use of these
methods, whilst Mankiewicz<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a> and Goldstein<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a> obtained no results
whatever. Kimballâs<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a> careful investigations have shown that a decoction
of bitter herbs recommended by Behrends<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a> (tansy, wormwood)
have just as little effect as the tobacco decoction employed by
Boerhave<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a> and Kilgour.<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a> The sternutatories employed by the older
physicians are entirely neglected. Delasiauve<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a> experienced good
results from the inhalation of the smoke of paper cigarettes, which
were soaked with a solution of 2Â·0 pot. arsenic in 30Â·0 distilled water.
Whilst, according to Kimball, balsam of Peru had no effect on the
larvÃ¦, Mankiewicz succeeded in removing the larvÃ¦ from the nose
with the help of that drug. Turpentine steam or mixtures of turpentine
employed by Indian physicians have not been very effectual according
to Moore,<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a> Kimball and Goldstein. Success has been attained in
some cases by the use of insufflations of calomel (Roura,<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a> Cerna,<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a>
Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a>) or of iodoform (Pascal<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a>). Joseph<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a> recommends concentrated
alum solution being sniffed up into the nose as very effectual.
Sublimate and carbol solutions do not appear to be very successful
(Kimball, Moore, Goldstein), whilst benzine inhalations (Pierre<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a>)
have shown better results. Scheppegrell<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a> strongly recommends
injections of oil which kill the larvÃ¦, while it is perfectly harmless
to the nasal mucosa. Cesare<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a> employed nasal lavages with solutions
of salicylate of soda with good results, and Calamida<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a> lavages with
physiological saline solution. Bresgen<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a> recommends the nose being<span class="pagenum" title="720"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720"></a></span>
cocainized and the larvÃ¦ being removed with a pincette. Roorda-Smit<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a>
cocainized the nose, then insufflated calomel and plugged the
nose with a gauze tampon dusted with calomel. After two hours
fifty-six larvÃ¦ crawled out along the plug. Continuation of the
treatment resulted in a complete cure.</p>

<p>Injections of chloroform water (Jourdran<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a>) or chloroform inhalations,
or injections of pure chloroform into the nose, have proved
the most effectual (Goldstein,<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a> Osborn,<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a> Jourdran, Durham,<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a>

Folkes<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">1145</a>). Camphorated carbolic solutions are very well spoken of:
Grayson<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">1146</a> states that these kill the larvÃ¦ immediately. Some authors
have removed the larvÃ¦ with forceps (Goldstein<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a>), others with
pincettes; thus Brokaw extracted 200 fragments with the forceps,
Pascal eighty fragments with the pincettes, and Wolinz<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a> also appears
to have removed the larvÃ¦ with forceps.</p>

<p>Greater operative measures than these do not appear to have been
undertaken in latter days; yet Morgagni<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a> states that the army
surgeon, CÃ¦sar Mogatus, at Bologna, first trephined the frontal sinus
and then extracted a âwormâ from it.</p>

<p>LarvÃ¦ of other <i>MuscidÃ¦</i> have come under observation much more
rarely (Cheval<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a> [larvÃ¦ of <i>Galleria mellonella</i><a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a>], Bond,<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a> Dumesnil<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a>
[larvÃ¦ of <i>Piophila casei</i>]). Species of the genus Scolopendra
(<i>Myriapoda</i>), which all shun the light and seek their food during the
night&mdash;which consists of animal and vegetable substances&mdash;frequently
make their way into the nasal cavities of people when asleep. They
are found not only in the nose, but in the accessory cavities. In the
chapter on the âParasites of the Noseâ<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">1154</a> we have collected striking<span class="pagenum" title="721"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721"></a></span>
instances, but we have omitted to mention the observation made by
Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a> (Scolopendra in sinus maxillaris) and that made by Bergmann<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a>
(Scolopendra in sinus frontalis). In the same chapter some
remarks are made as to the occurrence in the nose of earwigs, caterpillars,
scorpions and termites, as well as of animals which have not
been identified.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ that develop in the auditory meatus penetrate the
membrana tympani, destroy the middle ear and may produce meningitis
and intracranial suppurations. In one case Vesescu<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a> extracted
seven living larvÃ¦ from the ear with the aid of a thin pair of pincettes.
KÃ¶hler<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a> recommends the infusion of drops of ol. terebinth. to destroy
the larvÃ¦, Quintano<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a> the insufflation of the following powder: Oxid.
hydrarg. rubr., sulfur., ÄÄ 1Â·0&nbsp;grm., pulv. gi. arab. 8Â·0&nbsp;grm.; Lesbini<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a>
recommends tincture of iodine. In the case reported by Henneberg<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">1161</a>
the larvÃ¦ were those of <i>Lucilia cÃ¦sar</i>.</p>

<p>Eye affections due to <i>Lucilia macellaria</i> are very uncommon; the
literature relating to the lesions of the eye produced by the larvÃ¦ of
flies has been collected in Kayserâs<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a> work. In the cases under the
observation of Schultz-Zeyden<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a> both the eyes of a female tramp were
destroyed, and quantities of larvÃ¦ were also found in the nasal fossÃ¦
and in the ears.</p>

<p>The Lucilia is found relatively seldom on the cutaneous surface.
Hennebergâs<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">1164</a> case was that of a neglected girl, aged 20, in whom
countless larvÃ¦ (<i>L. cÃ¦sar</i>) were found in a plica polonica; after the
plica polonica had been removed the scalp was found to be covered
with a large quantity of ulcers which swarmed with larvÃ¦, large and
small. The skin of the trunk was also much macerated and covered
with larvÃ¦. Death resulted from sepsis; WestenhÃ¶ffer<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">1165</a> remarks on
this case that a lesion of the head from which the patient had suffered
previously and the perpetual state of intoxication in which she was
had probably given rise to the lodgment of the fly larvÃ¦. Whether
the communications made by Munk<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">1166</a> of maggots in the mouth
relate to Lucilia I do not know. Vesescu,<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a> in one case with extensive<span class="pagenum" title="722"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722"></a></span>
ulceration and deep fistulÃ¦ in the skin, removed 176 larvÃ¦ with the
pincette. In Roorda-Smitâs<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a> case there were two ulcers in the neck
of a girl, aged 17, and larvÃ¦ appeared at their base. After dusting
with calomel and the application of a bandage the next day fifty-two
dead or half-dead larvÃ¦ came to light. Recovery took place.
Lesbini,<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a> in the case of an old lady, saw numerous larvÃ¦ in an ulcer
of the leg she was suffering from. Hectorâs<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a> case appears to have
been one of myiasis cutanea provoked by Lucilia.</p>

<p>The first exact observations of myiasis cutanea from <i>Sarcophaga
magnifica</i> are due to Wohlfahrt,<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a> in whose honour Portschinsky<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a>
named this species of fly <i>S. wohlfahrti</i>. Portschinsky ascertained that
<i>S. wohlfahrti</i> was not confined to man as its sole host, but that several
of our domestic animals, such as cattle, horses, pigs, dogs and geese,
were visited. In these animals small wounds serve to entice the flies
and to supply them with a suitable site for the deposition of their
eggs. The oral armature of the young larvÃ¦ renders it easy for them
to penetrate not only the mucosa and cutaneous surface but also
intact places in the submucous connective tissue. In many localities
more than half the herds have proved to be infected by the flies.
The fly only frequents open spaces and never enters human dwellings,
and is so timid that it approaches man only during sleep; infection,
therefore, takes place only out of doors, in summer, in clear, warm
weather, and only in such individuals as sleep in the open air.
Individuals are most exposed to risk who suffer from catarrhs or
inflammations, combined with purulent secretions of the nasal cavity
(ozÃ¦na), or otorrhÅa, or ulcers in any parts of the body accessible to
the female fly.</p>

<p>The frequency and intensity of the infection will be in inverse
proportion to the advance in civilization of the inhabitants, their idea
of cleanliness, their having timely medical aid and the chances of their
being rapidly attended to. On that account the majority of cases of
myiasis (Sarcophaga) are reported from Russia. The literature of this
kind of myiasis nasalis is not very extensive; in addition to Wohlfahrt,
Portschinsky and Joseph,<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a> there is a communication by GerstÃ¤cker,<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">1174</a>
who found fifteen adult larvÃ¦ of <i>S. wohlfahrti</i> in the nasal cavity of
one man. The larvÃ¦ transmitted from Ordruf by Dr. Thomas to
LÃ¶w,<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">1175</a> in Vienna, which were discharged from the nose of a woman,<span class="pagenum" title="723"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723"></a></span>
aged 71, suffering from ozÃ¦na, were recognized by the well-known
dipterologist Braun as belonging to <i>S. wohlfahrti</i>. Among the cases
reported by Joseph, one only affected the nose; it was that of a
peasant girl, aged 11, who had suffered from ozÃ¦na; she had
travelled on the open road and had there gone to sleep. Severe
symptoms set in and death followed under delirium. In making the
<i>post-mortem</i> it was found that the interior of the nose was extensively
destroyed by larvÃ¦ of <i>S. wohlfahrti</i>. Powell found Sarcophaga
larvÃ¦ in two persons who had slept in the open air; the larvÃ¦ were
killed by injections of chloroform and sublimate. Destruction of the
eyes by <i>S. wohlfahrti</i> has only been observed in a few cases; it is
reported by Cloquet<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a> that, in the case of a ragman who had lain
some time in the fields, both eyes were pierced by larvÃ¦. On the outer
skin the larvÃ¦ of <i>S. wohlfahrti</i> have been found more than once in
inflammatory or festering areas. Freund<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a> demonstrated that from
a five year old child, which had suffered for some time from an
impetiginous eczema of the skin of the head, from two suppurating
abscess cavities which extended to the periosteum, which was already
affected, twenty-one living larvÃ¦ were taken; rapid healing took place
under antiseptic bandaging.</p>

<p>The small treatise by Balzer and Schimpff<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">1178</a> contains two new
observations on myiasis externa; in the one case an ulcer on a manâs
foot was full of larvÃ¦, in the other case the head of a woman showed
numerous larvÃ¦ without the skin of the head being destroyed.
Brandtâs<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">1179</a> observation is interesting, for he found such larvÃ¦ in the
gums of a sick person.</p>

<p>The impression which one obtains of the active movement of
larvÃ¦ on wounds is a strange and at the same time uncanny one.
One finds that the larvÃ¦ to obtain protection against the drying of
the surface of the abscess almost incessantly burrow with their heads,
first contracting and then expanding the body, which rises and falls,
and keeping the tail upwards. Owing to these movements producing
irritation, increase of inflammation may ultimately arise, causing
erysipelas and cellulitis.</p>

<p>The treatment of myiasis nasalis caused by Sarcophaga is the same
as in myiasis caused by Lucilia, and in the other places where found it is
merely a question of the removal of the larvÃ¦ and the subsequent
proper treatment of the surface of the abscess. In Northern Nigeria<span class="pagenum" title="724"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724"></a></span>
Lelean<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a> found <i>Auchmeromyia depressa</i> to be the cause of myiasis
externa.<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a></p>

<p>The occurrence of Oestrid larvÃ¦ in a human being is very rare,
at least up till now myiasis oestrosa has been very seldom observed
in man in Europe. Whilst the hosts of the <i>MuscidÃ¦</i> comprise a
considerable number of warm-blooded animals, on which the larvÃ¦
develop, each species of the <i>OestridÃ¦</i> appears, on the other hand, to
have a definite host or some definite hosts of the class Mammalia.
No species of Oestrid is peculiar to man. Although in America, as
well as in Europe, <i>Oestrus hominis</i> was spoken of up to the middle of
the last century, no such species exists.</p>

<p>But in both hemispheres, in America much more often than in
Europe, Oestrid larvÃ¦ have been found in man. In Florida, Mexico,
New Granada, Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica and other districts,
and especially where large herds of cattle are kept, myiasis oestrosa
has been observed in shepherds, huntsmen and amongst the rural
population. The larvÃ¦ of <i>Hypoderma bovis</i>, according to the observations
of Goudot,<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a> occur as a parasite in man. Poilroux<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a> found larvÃ¦
of cavicolous <i>OestridÃ¦</i> in the nose of a man, aged 55. Amongst
the species of warble flies, whose larvÃ¦ are parasites in domestic
animals and game in Europe, reliable observers have found larvÃ¦ of
two kinds, <i>Hypoderma bovis</i> and <i>Hypoderma diana</i>, also in man.<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">1184</a></p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ of <i>H. bovis</i> have very seldom been observed in the nose.
The case quoted by Kirschmann,<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">1185</a> which was that of a peasant
woman, aged 50, who was suffering from ozÃ¦na, and in which
violent attacks of sneezing, epistaxis, pain in the forehead, and swelling
of the face were observed, is, according to LÃ¶w<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">1186</a> and Joseph,<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">1187</a> not
an Oestrid; Muscid larvÃ¦ were evidently the cause. By the injection
of diluted iron chloride solution seventy-nine larvÃ¦ were removed
from the nose. In the case reported by Razoux<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">1188</a> the species
of larva is not definitely known&mdash;at least, v. Frantzius<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">1189</a> did not
consider them Oestrid larvÃ¦. Joseph does not definitely say that
Oestrid larvÃ¦ were the cause of a case which he quotes. He was sent
a number of uninjured larvÃ¦ of <i>Oestrus ovis</i> ready to pupate, which<span class="pagenum" title="725"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725"></a></span>
were said to have been expelled, during violent sneezing, from the
nose of a peasant woman who had suffered for six months from
continuous frontal headache and chronic nasal catarrh.</p>

<p>The Oestrides prefer to use the surfaces of wounds on the skin of
man to lay their eggs, which develop into larvÃ¦; but they often use
their ovipositors<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">1190</a> to make a fresh wound. In this case there arise in
the skin, and particularly in the subcutaneous connective tissue of the
neck, in the region of the shoulder, as well as in other parts of the
body painful, furuncle-like inflammations which are known under
the name of gad-fly boils. These boils may become the size of pigeonsâ
eggs; if several are together, they appear to form a connected tumour.
Each tumour is elastic and somewhat movable, and has an orifice
through which the larva breathes and discharges its excreta. At
times these turn to festers and gangrenous disintegrations, which may
even cause the loss of a limb. Wilms<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a> had the opportunity a few
years ago of observing a case of myiasis dermatosa oestrosa in Leipzig.
The fistula which led to the larva was slit open and the larva extracted.
As a notable characteristic of myiasis oestrosa Joseph states that the
larvÃ¦ grow very slowly. The flight time of the <i>OestridÃ¦</i> is the hot
summer months.</p>

<p>Adams<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a> observed on the Isthmus of Panama a number of cases
of a skin disease which is caused by the larvÃ¦ of <i>Dermatobia noxialis</i>
(<i>Gusano-peludo-Muche</i>). The larvÃ¦ penetrate not only the skin but
also the mucous membrane of the pharynx and larynx, and from there
proceed through the tissue to the subcutaneous cellular tissue. The
infection seems to result from bathing.</p>

<p>The study of âthimni,â a human myiasis caused by <i>Oestrus ovis</i>,
by Ed. and Et. Sergent,<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a> deals more with the zoology and with the
geographical distribution of this insect in North Africa than with the
clinical appearances of myiasis. [This paper deals with matters of
great interest, with important facts.&mdash;F.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;T.]</p>

<p>The treatment consists in the removal of the larvÃ¦ (from the
nose); in Brazil it is the custom to drop tobacco juice into the
boil in order to kill the larvÃ¦ (Strauch<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a>).</p>

<p>One is only justified in speaking of myiasis intestinalis when there
is no doubt that living fly maggots or flies themselves can be proved
to have been found in the fresh contents of the stomach or intestine<span class="pagenum" title="726"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726"></a></span>
(Schlesinger and Weichselbaum<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">1195</a>). In the discussion of myiasis
intestinalis we give the evidence of Schlesinger and Weichselbaum,
as well as that of Wirsing,<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">1196</a> to which must be added a number
of other investigations.</p>

<p>In a great number of acute cases apparently only the stomach was
affected, there being no signs in the intestine. In these cases sudden
illness is noticed, colic, sometimes unbearable pains in the region of
the stomach, pyrosis, vomiting or continuous intense inclination to
vomit, occasionally even with the mixture of blood. Frequently a
general feeling of malaise, twinges of pain in the muscles, and attacks
of giddiness were notified, very rarely fever. Generally all the
symptoms disappeared in a short time when the larvÃ¦ had been
removed by an act of vomiting or by washing out the stomach.</p>

<p>It is well to note that in the history of many cases the pains
preceding the expulsion of the larvÃ¦ are stated to be extremely
violent.</p>

<p>Acute myiasis of the intestinal canal frequently runs a course
without special symptoms and is only an accidental condition; one
has, however, in such cases to guard against errors. The fÃ¦ces may
be deposited in vessels or places where fly larvÃ¦ are in great numbers,
or a subsequent infection of the fÃ¦ces with the eggs or larvÃ¦ of flies
may have taken place. Only when the inspection of the excrement
immediately following defÃ¦cation proves the presence of living larvÃ¦,
and when there were certainly no fly larvÃ¦ in the vessel previously,
can one speak of the passing of fly larvÃ¦ from the intestine. More
frequent than the cases showing no special symptoms are those with
pronounced disturbances in the intestinal passage, obstruction or
diarrhÅa (also constipation and diarrhÅa alternately), violent and
sometimes agonizing abdominal pains (Pottiez<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">1197</a>), which preceded
the evacuation of the larvÃ¦ and subsided after their removal. General
symptoms, like weakness, languor, transitory vague pains, loss of
appetite, sickness, rarely fever, giddiness, attacks of faintness, epileptic
attacks (Krause<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">1198</a>) are observed. In a few cases blood and pus have
been noticed in the evacuation of the bowels.</p>

<p>In the cases of chronic myiasis of the intestine the aspect of the
disease is dominated by the complex symptom of colitis mucosa.</p>

<p>The following features are noticeable, namely, the intermittent
passing of blood, the influence over the expulsion of the larvÃ¦ of
mechanical procedure (massaging of the abdomen), the duration of
the process for several years, the sometimes enormous number of<span class="pagenum" title="727"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727"></a></span>
insects contained in the dejecta. Another clinically important factor
is the passing of the larvÃ¦ in batches. While for some time no larvÃ¦
may appear in the stools, they may suddenly be ejected in great
numbers, either because the conditions of feeding are not suitable,
or because medicaments remove them from the intestine. The
hÃ¦morrhage is ascribed by Schlesinger and Weichselbaum directly
to lesions of the mucous membrane caused by the larvÃ¦; in the case
reported by these writers there were found shreds of tissue as well as
pus in the stool. The pains occurring spontaneously in the abdomen
are at times influenced by position and attitude of the body, often
they were more violent after rest and after evacuation of the bowels;
often they were continuous, but in that case less intense; pressure on
the abdomen is generally little felt. The condition of the blood was
in two cases (Pasquale<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">1199</a> and Schlesinger and Weichselbaum) a marked
chlorotic one. The state of nutrition seems almost always to suffer
with prolongation of the disease, but in Peiperâs<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">1200</a> cases this was not
so. The condition of the appetite was in some instances good, in
others very bad. A frequent symptom is headache of a migraine-like
character and neuralgic pains in different parts.</p>

<p>Schlesinger and Weichselbaumâs case shows that there are forms
of myiasis intestinalis which, after prolonged sickness, lead to death,
and that in consequence of the formation of intestinal abscesses
stricture of the intestine may arise from the subsequent formation of
a scar.</p>

<p>The question of the mode of infection is interesting; in this
mouth, nose and anus must be considered. The most frequent way
is certainly by means of food on which flies have laid their eggs, or
which is permeated with young maggots. This may be raw (especially
grated) meat, cheese, fruit, salad, milk, cabbage, cold farinaceous
foods, raspberries. When the stomach is affected, when the gastric
juice has lost acidity and power of digestion, the larvÃ¦ will be able
to stay and develop more easily. According to Csokor,<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">1201</a> if the eggs
get into the gastro-intestinal canal of man with the food, the delicate
stages of the young larvÃ¦ would certainly not survive the action of
the gastric juice. Salzmann<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">1202</a> assumed that the invasion occasionally
occurred through the rectum, the larvÃ¦ creeping into the anus while
the person is asleep. Wirsing accepts this method of infection for
two of his cases, where it was a question of the infection of an infant.
Salzmann<a href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">1202</a> reports a case where the maggots of <i>Anthomyia</i><a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">1203</a> <i>scalaris</i><span class="pagenum" title="728"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728"></a></span>
were passed in great numbers from the urethra of an old man. The
patient had been catheterized on account of urethral stricture and was
probably infected with eggs or larvÃ¦ at the same time.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of the affection is easy and sure, if living larvÃ¦ are
found in the contents of the stomach or in the stools, and if contamination
is out of the question.</p>

<p>The number of different species of flies whose larvÃ¦ are found in
myiasis intestinalis is considerable. The larvÃ¦ of species of Anthomyia
(<i>A. canicularis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">1204</a> <i>A. scalaris</i>, <i>etc.</i>), of <i>Sarcophaga carnaria</i> and
<i>S. magnifica</i> and of <i>Musca vomitoria</i><a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">1205</a> are especially observed.</p>

<p>The prognosis is certainly generally favourable, but must be made
with some reserve in chronic cases, in view of the observations of
Schlesinger and Weichselbaum (intestinal stenosis).</p>

<p>The treatment must aim at removing the larvÃ¦ as soon as possible
from the digestive canal.</p>

<p>In cases of myiasis of the stomach, a thorough washing out of the
stomach (Joseph,<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">1206</a> Staniek<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">1207</a>) is to be preferred to emetics used with
success in individual instances; perhaps it would be advisable to add
menthol or thymol to the mixture.</p>

<p>In myiasis of the intestine internal remedies and local treatment
of the intestine must be considered.</p>

<p>So far santonin seems to have proved to be the best remedy.
In some cases extract. filicis maris, calomel, semina cucurbitÃ¦,
naphthalene 0Â·1 to 0Â·5 (Peiper<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">1208</a>), infus. of Persian insect powder
(5 in 200), mineral waters, Carlsbad water, seem to have had good
results.</p>

<p>For irrigation of the rectum, weak solutions of argentum nitricum,
tannin, thymol, gelatine, ol. ricini, naphthalene may be used. Wirsing
administered an aperient (Rurella compound liquorice powder) and
a soap enema after the passing of the first larvÃ¦.</p>

<p>The principal thing is the prophylaxis, which must include the
careful protection of articles of food, on which flies may lay their
eggs (protection by glass dishes, tulle or fine wire nets). Fruit
should not be eaten before being washed or rubbed with a cloth.</p>

<p>Under the name âcreeping disease,â R.&nbsp;J. Lee<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">1209</a> has recorded
a peculiar affection of the skin in a three year old girl, which appeared
first in the form of pale red, thread-like irregular protuberances,
which seemed partly to become entwined on the right malleolus
and had spread without causing special disturbances to the abdomen.
Dickinson, Fox and Duckworth<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">1210</a> reported, in connection with this,
that they observed a growth of this red line of about 1&nbsp;in. per
diem. Since then a number of similar cases have been reported
which, without doubt, were cases of larvÃ¦ creeping under the
skin. Crocker<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">1211</a> saw such a case in a two year old girl, the progress
of the red line varying in one night between 4 and <span class="nowrap">7â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&nbsp;in. In Europe
the first case was observed in Vienna, by v. Neumann and Rille,<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">1212</a>
also in a two year old girl.</p>

<p>v. Samson-Himmelstjerna,<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">1213</a> Sokoloff,<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">1214</a> Rawnitzky<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">1215</a> found larvÃ¦
at the end of the tract, which had been recorded as larvÃ¦ of Gastrophilus
by Cholodowsky.<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">1216</a> According to Blanchard (<i>Arch. f. Par.</i>,
1901) the larvÃ¦ were those of <i>Hypoderma bovis</i>.</p>

<p>How these larvÃ¦ get into the skin has not yet been definitely
ascertained; v. Samson is of the opinion that they usually obtain
access to man as larvÃ¦, Stelwagon<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a> believes that the infection
generally occurs in a seaside watering place; a patient of
Ehrmannâs<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a> fell ill when he returned from the manÅuvres, where
he had lain for some time on the ground. Here and there it is
reported that the eruption was preceded for a longer or shorter time
by lesions of the skin (incised wounds, furuncles, slight excoriations,
v. Harlingen<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a>).</p>

<p>Twice it has been suggested that perhaps the parasites might come
from vineyard snails (Crocker, Lenglet and Delaunay<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a>), and it is<span class="pagenum" title="730"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730"></a></span>
pointed out by v. Samson that in Russia the infection of peasants
who work in the fields was specially frequent. It is noticeable how
frequently the affection begins on uncovered parts of the body (face,
hands, arms); but that fact, on the whole, is not in conflict with the
statement (Kengsep<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a>) that the disease makes its first appearance
over the nates, because children often sit on the ground and play
with that part of their body uncovered. A case observed by us was
that of an elderly lady who did not do this and was properly clothed,
yet showed the typical lines of creeping disease on the nates, and
asserted again and again that she had the feeling as if a worm were
creeping under her skin.</p>

<p>The disease occurs in children as well as adults, so that age, sex
and calling offer no determining point etiologically.</p>

<p>The clinical symptoms of the disease consist in the sudden
appearance of itching and burning; if the cause is looked for one
perceives a red line, raised but little above the surface of the skin,
with irregular curves, never branched, but often entwined, broadening
more or less rapidly at one end (1 to 15&nbsp;cm. in twenty-four hours).
The larva can be seen sometimes with a lens under pressure of the
skin as a dark spot; formations of pus, such as other larvÃ¦ produce,
are not noticed; now and again there is a formation of little vesicles
(Hamburger,<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a> v. Harlingen,<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a> Bruno,<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a> Ehrmann,<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a> Brodier and
Fouquet,<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a> Rawnitzky<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a>). It may happen that the parasite burrows
through a small region of the skin with many close curves for some
time; on the other hand, observations exist where it covered large
tracts in a short time. The itching and smarting cease in the place
left by the larva, so that the patients even in the shortest tract can
point out at which end the larva is, even if they have not watched
the lengthening of the tract. Very rarely the larva invades the
mucous membrane of the mouth, the nose, and the conjunctiva,
proceeding from thence to the external cutaneous area.</p>

<p>The localization of the affection is very varied; the primary seat
has been observed on the glutei muscles (Lee, Kengsep, Morris,<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a>
Rille, Seifert) and their surroundings (Stelwagon, Hamburger,
Bruno), on the lower extremities (Stelwagon, Lenglet and Delaunay,
Hutchins, Moorhead, Lee, Crocker, Schmid,<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a> v. Harlingen), on the<span class="pagenum" title="731"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731"></a></span>
upper extremities (Samson, Meade and Freeman, Hutchins, Sokoloff,
v. Harlingen, Brodier and Fouquet, Shelmire,<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a> Stelwagon), on the
face (Sokoloff, Moorhead, Kumberg,<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a> Rawnitzky, Crocker, Boas<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a>),
on the neck (Sokoloff), and on the body (Ehrmann, Brodier and
Fouquet, Kaposi,<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a> Topsent<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a>).</p>

<p>The duration of the affection varies very much; it varies between
a few hours and some years<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a>; several times a spontaneous recovery
has been reported.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of the disease is not at all difficult owing to its
peculiar appearance.</p>

<p>The treatment can only consist in the removal or killing of the
larvÃ¦, since one cannot rely on spontaneous recovery, even if it has
occurred in some cases. If one should succeed in locating the larva
as a black spot at the end of the tract, its removal by means
of a needle is the simplest method (Quortrup and Boas<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a>). In
some instances a cure has been successfully accomplished by excision
of the active end of the tract (v. Neumann and Rille, Schmid). In
opposition to this method, which not all patients will allow, the
method practised by Arab women (Rille and Riecke<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a>) of killing the
worm with red hot needles is quite rational. Shelmire<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a> used the
electrolytic needle for the destruction of the maggots, Stelwagon<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">1239</a>
made use of cataphoresis, by means of which he applied a sublimate
solution, afterwards cauterizing with a drop of nitric acid,
as excision was refused. Crocker<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">1240</a> and v. Harlingen<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">1241</a> injected
small quantities of carbolic acid; Moorhead<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">1242</a> by a single freezing
of the skin with ethyl chloride, attained a definite cessation of the
attack at the active end. Hutchins<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">1243</a> in one case made use of hypodermic
injection of a few drops of solution of cocaine and afterwards
of 1 to 2 drops of chloroform; in a second case of repeated applications
of tincture of iodide, as Lenglet and Delaunay<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">1244</a> did.<span class="pagenum" title="732"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732"></a></span>
v. Harlingen<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a> allayed the affection in his first case by rubbing in
sapo viridis and tar, in Kensepâs<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">1246</a> case the cure seems to have been
accomplished by an ointment containing resorcin, in Meade and
Freemanâs<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a> case by a 20 per cent. ichthyol paste. In our case we
made exclusive use of Lassarâs paste; within four weeks a cure
resulted, probably spontaneously, since one cannot ascribe any
essential effect to this paste.</p>

<h5>I.&mdash;NOTES ON RECENT RESEARCHES.</h5>

<p>Since the foregoing section on Protozoology was sent to press,
certain interesting observations and results have been published.
Brief notes on such, and some references thereto, are now added.</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, to remark that sometimes it is impossible
to give a precise or rigid definition to a genus of Protozoa, owing to
differences of opinion, to differences regarding nomenclature or to
incompleteness of knowledge. Such a lack of definition, while inconvenient
for the time being, is not unhopeful, as it directs attention to
the necessity for further work, which is inevitable in such a relatively
new and wide subject as protozoology. Thus, it may be noted in
illustration that Minchin, in 1912, in his text-book regarding the
genus <i>EntamÅba</i> writes: âThe entozoic amÅbÃ¦ are commonly
placed in a distinct genus, <i>EntamÅba</i>, distinguished from the free-living
forms by little, however, except their habitat and the general
(but not invariable) absence of a contractile vacuole.â</p>

<p><b>Differences between EntamÅba histolytica and E. coli.</b>&mdash;In
continuation of the remarks on pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_34">34</a> and <a href="#Page_40">40</a>, it may be added that
Lugolâs solution (iodine in aqueous potassium iodide solution) in
fresh specimens shows by brownish staining the presence of glycogen
in the vacuoles of <i>EntamÅba coli</i>. Such a reaction is rarely or never
given by <i>E. histolytica</i>.</p>

<p><b>PhagedÃ¦nic AmÅbÃ¦.</b>&mdash;Carini and others record cases in which
the skin around an operation wound in connection with liver abscess
became gangrenous. AmÅbÃ¦, possibly <i>EntamÅba histolytica</i>, were
found therein and may have been responsible for the gangreno-phagedÃ¦nic
action.</p>

<p><b>EndamÅba gingivalis</b> (<i>see</i> pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_43">43</a>, 44).&mdash;Smith and Barrett,<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a> after<span class="pagenum" title="734"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734"></a></span>
analysing the early literature, state (June, 1915) that <i>EndamÅba
gingivalis</i>, Gros, 1849, is the correct name for the following organisms:
<i>E. buccalis</i>, Prowazek, 1904 (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_43">43</a>); <i>AmÅba gingivalis</i>, Gros, 1849;
<i>AmÅba buccalis</i>, Steinberg, 1862, and <i>AmÅba dentalis</i>, Grassi, 1879.
They conclude that <i>E. gingivalis</i> is the causal agent of pyorrhÅa
alveolaris, and that this disease responds to treatment with emetine.</p>

<p><b>EntamÅba kartulisi</b> (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_44">44</a>), synonym <i>E. maxillaris</i>, Kartulis,
is considered to be <i>E. gingivalis</i>.</p>

<p>Smith and Barrett adopt the generic name <i>EndamÅba</i>, Leidy,
1879 (<i>see</i> footnote on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_31">31</a>, also p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_34">34</a>). Leidy worked on <i>EndamÅba
blattÃ¦</i>.</p>

<p><b>Craigia and Craigiasis</b> (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_45">45</a>).&mdash;Barlow<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a> (May, 1915) found
<i>Craigia</i> (<i>ParamÅba</i>) <i>hominis</i> in cases of chronic diarrhÅa and mild
dysentery in Honduras. He also described a new species of <i>Craigia</i>
under the name of <i>C. migrans</i>. Fifty-six cases were studied, five of
which were due to <i>Craigia hominis</i>, the remainder to <i>C. migrans</i>.
In <i>C. migrans</i>, each flagellate, on attaining full development, becomes
an amÅba without dividing. Each amÅba encysts and produces
a number of flagellates which are somewhat like cercomonads. On
the other hand, in <i>C. hominis</i> the flagellate form produces, by longitudinal
fission, several generations of flagellates before entering upon
the amÅbic stage. The cysts of <i>C. migrans</i> contain fewer âswarmersâ
(flagellulÃ¦) than those of <i>C. hominis</i>, but the âswarmersâ are somewhat
larger, namely, 5&nbsp;Âµ instead of 3&nbsp;Âµ in diameter. Further, there is
no accessory nuclear body in <i>C. migrans</i>, but its flagellum stains
more deeply than that of <i>C. hominis</i> and has a peculiar banded
appearance.</p>

<p><b>Human Trichomoniasis</b> (<i>see</i> pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_52">52</a>â56).&mdash;Lynch<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a> (April and
May, 1915), working in Charleston, seems to favour the view that
the trichomonads found in the vagina, urethra, mouth, lungs and
alimentary tract are one and the same organism, and that these
flagellates may further excite already existing inflammatory conditions.
He gives detailed histories of cases of (<i>a</i>) infection of the
vagina and gums, and (<i>b</i>) intestinal infection manifested as intermittent
attacks of diarrhÅa. The flagellates were found in catarrhal
vaginal discharge, in blood-stained scrapings from the gums (together
with <i>EndamÅba buccalis</i>), and in stools after a purge of magnesium
sulphate. The parasites were tetratrichomonads (<i>see</i> footnote, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_53">53</a>),
that is, each possessed four flagella anteriorly as well as an undulating
membrane. Lynch successfully infected rabbits from the cases and
from cultures of the parasite. Encysted trichomonads were seen in a<span class="pagenum" title="735"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735"></a></span>
patientâs stools, in rabbits infected therefrom and in cultures. The
culture medium used was bouillon acidified with about 0Â·05 per cent.
acetic acid and the cultures were maintained at 30Â°&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>Trichomonads occur in the digestive tracts, for example, the cÃ¦ca
of rats and mice (fig.&nbsp;422). In man allied flagellates can occur in
similar situations, as well as in other parts of the intestine.</p>

<p>Other trichomonad-like organisms have been recently described
from the fÃ¦ces of man, more particularly from cases of chronic
dysentery in the tropics. Derrieu and Raynaud<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a> (July, 1914), working
in Algeria, found a flagellate possessing five free flagella anteriorly
and an undulating membrane apparently lateral. They named the
parasite <i>Hexamastix ardin-delteili</i>, but the generic name <i>Hexamastix</i>
is pre-occupied. Chatterjee<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">1252</a> (January, 1915), working in India, found
probably the same flagellate and called it <i>Pentatrichomonas bengalensis</i>.</p>

<p><b>Chilomastix</b> (<b>Tetramitus</b>) <b>mesnili</b> (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_57">57</a>).&mdash;Alexeieff<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a> (1914)
now places the parasite originally called <i>Macrostoma mesnili</i>, by
Wenyon (1910), in the genus <i>Chilomastix</i>, Alexeieff. The differential
characters of the genera <i>Tetramitus</i> and <i>Chilomastix</i> are not especially
well marked. According to Alexeieff, <i>Tetramitus</i> is characterized by
four unequal flagella (which he figures anteriorly), a ventral cytostome
in the form of a linear cleft and a pulsatile vacuole in front of the
anterior nucleus. <i>Chilomastix</i>, according to the same author, has<span class="pagenum" title="736"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736"></a></span>
three forwardly directed flagella and a fourth backwardly directed one
in the cytostome, which is well developed (fig.&nbsp;423). Some authors
consider that the fourth flagellum forms the edge of an undulating
membrane in the cytostome.</p>

<p>Diagrams of <i>Chilomastix mesnili</i> are given in fig.&nbsp;423.</p>

<p><b>Giardia</b> (<b>Lamblia</b>) <b>intestinalis</b> (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_57">57</a>).&mdash;Alexeieff<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">1254</a> (1914) considers
that <i>Lamblia intestinalis</i>, Lambl, should be placed in the genus
<i>Giardia</i>, Kunstler, 1882. Bipartition occurs in the encysted state.
The axostyles persist in the quadrinucleate cyst.</p>

<p><b>Cercomonas hominis</b> (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_61">61</a>).&mdash;This parasite is considered by
some authors to be of a doubtful nature, as it is thought to have been
mistaken for deformed or incompletely observed <i>Trichomonas</i> or <i>Chilomastix</i>
or even <i>Lamblia</i>.</p>

<p>Wenyon<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">1255</a> (1910) described <i>Cercomonas longicauda</i> from cultures
of human fÃ¦ces. It is considered that the genus is very confused,
and the author points out that the tail flagellum has been overlooked.
He considers that the genus <i>Cercomonas</i> should include flagellates
with an anterior blunt end from which arises a single long flagellum,
and a posterior tapering end also with a flagellum, which can be traced<span class="pagenum" title="737"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737"></a></span>
over the surface of the body towards the insertion of the anterior
flagellum.</p>

<p>Another species, <i>Cercomonas parva</i>, has been found in cultures of
human fÃ¦ces by Hartmann and Chagas<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">1256</a> (1910). It has a somewhat
different structure.</p>

<p>Further researches are necessary on the organisms variously
referred to the genus <i>Cercomonas</i>.</p>

<p><b>Transmissive Phase of Trypanosomes in Vertebrates.</b>&mdash;In
addition to the general remarks on the morphology of trypanosomes
set forth on pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_70">70</a> to 72, it may be noted that Woodcock<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">1257</a> (November,
1914) states that, in certain cases, there is a definite transmissive phase of
a trypanosome in its vertebrate host. He quotes the work of Minchin
and himself on <i>T. noctuÃ¦</i> of the little owl, in which the transmissive
form is spindle-shaped and occurs in the birdâs peripheral blood
during the early summer months (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_69">69</a>). A similar phase occurs
in <i>T. fringillarum</i>, and Robertson<a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">1258</a> has found that the short, stumpy
form of <i>T. gambiense</i> is its transmissive phase in vertebrates.</p>

<p><b>Trypanosoma lewisi</b> (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_88">88</a>).&mdash;Brown (1914â15) has published
some interesting results on the potential pathogenicity of <i>T. lewisi.</i></p>

<p><b>Blepharoplastless Trypanosomes</b> (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_101">101</a>).&mdash;Laveran<a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">1259</a> (April,
1915) suggested a practical use of strains of blepharoplastless trypanosomes
produced by the action of drugs. He finds that tryposafrol
will also produce such strains, and remarks on blepharoplastless
strains of <i>T. evansi</i> and <i>T. brucei</i>, which in the former case can
undergo 450 passages without reversion, and in the latter 273
passages. He states that if it is desired to inoculate surra or nagana
to CapridÃ¦ or BovidÃ¦ in order to produce immunity, use should be
made of the blepharoplastless races of the respective trypanosomes,
which races are a little less virulent than the corresponding normal
ones. Also, the immunity which follows from an infection due to
blepharoplastless <i>T. evansi</i> or <i>T. brucei</i> is only a little less complete
than that following infections from either of the respective normal
strains.</p>

<p><b>The Experimental Introduction of certain Insect Flagellates
into various Vertebrates, and its bearing on the Evolution of
Leishmaniasis.</b>&mdash;In continuation of the remarks on pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_103">103</a>, 104,
and <a href="#Page_112">112</a>, further researches have been conducted on the introduction
into vertebrates of flagellates normally parasitic in insects. The
vertebrates became infected by inoculation with the flagellates or by<span class="pagenum" title="738"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738"></a></span>
being fed on insects containing the protozoa. Fantham and Porter<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">1260</a>
(June, 1915) published the following results. Flagellates from
sanguivorous and non-sanguivorous insects were used, and cold-blooded
as well as warm-blooded vertebrates as hosts. The introduced
protozoa were pathogenic to the mammals, but not markedly
so to the cold-blooded vertebrates. <i>Herpetomonas jaculum</i>, <i>H. stratiomyiÃ¦</i>,
<i>H. pediculi</i>, and <i>Crithidia gerridis</i> (parasitic in certain waterbugs)
proved pathogenic to mice. A puppy was infected by way
of the digestive tract with <i>H. ctenocephali</i>. Frogs became infected
with <i>H. jaculum</i> and with <i>C. gerridis</i>, toads and grass snakes with
<i>H. jaculum</i>, lizards with <i>C. gerridis</i>, and sticklebacks with <i>H. jaculum</i>.
Second and third passages of some of the parasites were obtained.
The protozoa, whether <i>Herpetomonas</i> or <i>Crithidia</i>, were present in
the vertebrate hosts in either the non-flagellate or the flagellate form,
or usually both. They were more abundant in the internal organs
of the hosts, more particularly in the liver, spleen and bone-marrow.
In all experiments in which <i>C. gerridis</i> was used the parasite
invariably retained the crithidial facies in the vertebrate host. No
transition to a trypanosome was ever seen. Infections in adult
animals were not so heavy as in the young ones, and the parasites
were more virulent in young hosts, as is the case with Mediterranean
kala-azar in children.</p>

<p>The mode of infection of the vertebrate in Nature seems to be
contaminative, either by its food or through an already existing
abrasion or puncture on the surface of its body. Cases in which the
flagellate-infected insects have been allowed to suck the blood of
vertebrates have proved negative up to the present. In areas where
leishmaniases are endemic, an examination should be made of all
insects and other invertebrates likely to come into contact with men
or dogs, or rats and mice (see below), in order to ascertain if these
invertebrates harbour herpetomonads. Preventive measures should
be directed against such invertebrates, especially arthropods. Further,
it is likely that certain vertebrates, such as reptiles and amphibia
(especially those that are insectivorous), may serve as reservoirs
of leishmaniases, or, as they should preferably be termed, herpetomoniases.
From such reservoirs the herpetomonads may reach
man by the agency of ectoparasites or flies, especially such as are
sanguivorous.</p>

<p>That vertebrates in Nature can harbour herpetomonads in their
blood has been shown by the work of Dutton and Todd (1903) on
the herpetomonads of Gambian mice, while the recently published<span class="pagenum" title="739"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739"></a></span>
investigations of Fantham and Porter<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">1261</a> (June, 1915) on natural herpetomonads
in the blood of mice in England have shown that these
rodents may be a natural reservoir of herpetomoniasis. The origin
of the infection of mice is to be sought in a flagellate of an ectoparasite
of the mouse, very probably <i>Herpetomonas pattoni</i> parasitic in
various fleas, which protozoÃ¶n can adapt itself to life in the blood
of mice. Herpetomonads were also found naturally in the blood
of birds by Sergent (1907). Recently, Fantham and Porter have
successfully infected birds with herpetomonads experimentally.</p>

<p>The significance of insect flagellates in relation to the evolution of
disease has recently been set forth by Fantham<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">1262</a> (June, 1915). The
deductions to be made from the occurrence of a herpetomonad stage
in <i>Leishmania</i>, especially in <i>L. tropica</i>, in man himself, and of flagellate
stages of the so-called <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i> in man are fully
discussed and correlated. It is pointed out that flagellosis of plants
(see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_104">104</a>) may possibly be connected with leishmaniasis. The
evolution of <i>Leishmania</i> from flagellates of invertebrates is thus
traced and the way again indicated for preventive measures against
leishmaniasis, as first set forth by Dodds Price and Rogers.</p>

<p>Franchini and Mantovani (March, 1915) have successfully
infected rats and mice by inoculation or by feeding with <i>Herpetomonas
muscÃ¦ domesticÃ¦</i> obtained from flies and from cultures.</p>

<p>It is of great interest to note that the recent observations of
Ed. and Et. Sergent, Lemaire and Senevet<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">1263</a> (1914) have demonstrated
the presence of a herpetomonad flagellate in cultures of the blood
and organs of geckos obtained from areas in Algeria in which Oriental
sore, due to <i>L. tropica</i>, is prevalent. <i>Phlebotomus</i> flies, which may
harbour a natural herpetomonad, feed on the geckos and on men.
Hence animals like geckos may possibly act as reservoirs of
leishmaniasis. Lindsay<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">1264</a> (1914) writes that the parasite of dermo-mucosal
leishmaniasis in Paraguay is believed by native sufferers to
be conserved in rattlesnakes, and spread by ticks or flies (<i>Simulium</i>)
feeding on the reptiles and transferring the parasite to man.</p>

<p><b>The Transmission of SpirochÃ¦ta duttoni</b> (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_116">116</a>).&mdash;It is
probable that <i>Ornithodorus savignyi</i> acts as the transmitting agent of
<i>S. duttoni</i> in places like Somaliland (Drake-Brockman, 1915).<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a></p>

<p><b>SpirochÃ¦ta bronchialis</b> (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_122">122</a>).&mdash;The morphology and life-history
of <i>S. bronchialis</i> have been investigated by Fantham<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">1266</a> (July,
1915). From researches conducted in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, he<span class="pagenum" title="740"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740"></a></span>
found that <i>S. bronchialis</i> is an organism presenting marked polymorphism,
a feature that has only been determined by the examination
of numerous preparations from the deeper bronchial regions of various
patients.</p>

<p><i>S. bronchialis</i> varies in length from 5&nbsp;Âµ to 27&nbsp;Âµ, and its breadth is
about 0Â·2&nbsp;Âµ to 0Â·6&nbsp;Âµ. These variations are due to the processes of
growth and division. Many of the parasites measure either 14&nbsp;Âµ to
16&nbsp;Âµ long, or 7&nbsp;Âµ, to 9&nbsp;Âµ, the latter resulting from transverse division
of the former. The ends show much variation in form, but approach
the acuminate type on the whole. The discrepancies in dimensions
given by the very few previous workers on the subject are probably
the result of the measurement of a limited number of parasites. All
such sizes can be found on some occasion during the progress of the
disease, when a larger number of spirochÃ¦tes is examined.</p>

<p>The movements of <i>S. bronchialis</i> are active, but of relatively short
duration, when it is removed from the body. The number of coils
of the spirochÃ¦te is rather an index of its rapidity of motion than a
fixed characteristic of the species.</p>

<p>The motile phase of <i>S. bronchialis</i> is succeeded by one of granule
formation, the granules or coccoid bodies serving as a resting stage
from which new spirochÃ¦tes are produced. The formation of
coccoid bodies and reproduction of spirochÃ¦tes from them can be
observed in life.</p>

<p><i>S. bronchialis</i> is a species distinct from the spirochÃ¦tes occurring
in the mouth. It differs from them in morphology, pathogenicity
and in staining reactions. It is not a developmental form of any
bacterium, and is an entity in itself.</p>

<p>The passage from man to man is effected most probably by means
of spirochÃ¦tes, and especially coccoid bodies, that leave the body in
the spray with expired air and by way of the nasal secretions. Owing
to the fragility and short life of <i>S. bronchialis</i> extracorporeally, the
resistant coccoid bodies in air, in dried sputum and dust, and possibly
also on the bodies of flies and other insects, are probably instrumental
in inducing attacks of bronchial spirochÃ¦tosis in human beings, especially
those having a lowered bodily resistance, such as occurs after
a chill. Lurie (December, 1915), has described a case from Serbia.</p>

<p><b>The SpirochÃ¦tes of the Human Mouth</b> (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_122">122</a>).&mdash;Two
species of spirochÃ¦tes were recorded as occurring in the human
mouth about forty or fifty years ago. These are <i>SpirochÃ¦ta buccalis</i>,
Steinberg (often ascribed to Cohn, 1875), and <i>S. dentium</i>, Miller
(often attributed to Koch, 1877).</p>

<p>The most recent work on <i>S. dentium</i> and <i>S. buccalis</i> is that of
Fantham<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">1267</a> (July, 1915), who observed the parasites ascribed to Cohn<span class="pagenum" title="741"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741"></a></span>
and to Koch, these being the two common spirochÃ¦tes seen in the
mouths of natives of the Sudan and of Europeans in England, as
well as the forms described and cultivated by recent investigators.
Some of the mouth spirochÃ¦tes are not very active, but there is
marked corkscrew and boring movement, and they are flexible.
Tangles or tomenta of these mouth spirochÃ¦tes are common.
Internal structure is seen with some difficulty, but in some specimens
it can be determined, and chromatin granules are then seen. MÃ¼hlens
(1907) figured stained specimens of <i>S. buccalis</i> and <i>S. dentium</i>, in
which chromatin-coloured granules were distributed along the bodies
of the organisms.</p>

<p><i>S. dentium</i> has tapering ends, and varies in length from 4&nbsp;Âµ to 10&nbsp;Âµ.
<i>S. dentium</i> is rather like <i>Treponema pallidum</i>, and has been placed by
some workers&mdash;for example, Dobell&mdash;in the genus <i>Treponema</i>. It has
already been mentioned, on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_128">128</a>, that Noguchi cultivated three
species of <i>Treponema</i> from the human mouth&mdash;namely, <i>T. macrodentium</i>,
<i>T. microdentium</i>, and <i>T. mucosum</i>, but they cannot be easily
distinguished morphologically, and so may appear to be biological
varieties of <i>S. dentium</i>.</p>

<p><i>S. buccalis</i> has somewhat rounded or bluntly acuminate ends
and varies in length from 9&nbsp;Âµ to 22&nbsp;Âµ. A slight membrane or crest
may sometimes be observed. <i>S. buccalis</i> was found to be the predominant
spirochÃ¦te in the mouths of eight natives examined by
Fantham in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.</p>

<p><i>S. buccalis</i> and <i>S. dentium</i> take up stains well and with relative
ease. Intracellular stages of the parasites are uncommon. Multiplication
by binary fission has also been observed. Coccoid bodies or
granule stages of the mouth spirochÃ¦tes are formed, but appear to be
relatively few in number.</p>

<p>J.&nbsp;G. and D. Thomson<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">1268</a> (1914) have written an interesting paper
on various spirochÃ¦tes occurring in the alimentary tract of man and
of some of the lower animals. They have also given a useful list of
references, and the work of some of the earlier authors is discussed in
the paper.</p>

<p>With regard to the general morphology of spirochÃ¦tes, it may be
noted that the so-called axial fibre of Zuelzer is acknowledged to be
homologous with the membrane or crista of molluscan spirochÃ¦tes.</p>

<p><b>Coccidia in Cattle.</b>&mdash;Regarding the remarks on coccidiosis or
âred dysenteryâ in cattle on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_147">147</a>, it may be added that Schultz<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">1269</a>
(July, 1915) has found the malady among cattle in the Philippine
Islands. He states that some irregular or atypical cases of apparent
rinderpest are really due to coccidia. As has been pointed out by<span class="pagenum" title="742"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742"></a></span>
Montgomery, rinderpest can be transmitted by blood inoculation,
while coccidiosis cannot be so transmitted, but may be diagnosed by
the microscope. These differences should be remembered as the two
diseases are often found to be associated and are difficult to separate
clinically. Coccidia have also been found in Australian cattle.</p>

<p><b>The HÃ¦mosporidia.</b>&mdash;It is likely that this order (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_151">151</a>) may
be soon abolished. Mesnil<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">1270</a> (April, 1915) considers that the grouping
of the three families, PlasmodiidÃ¦ (or HÃ¦mamÅbidÃ¦), HÃ¦mogregarinidÃ¦
and PiroplasmidÃ¦ in the order HÃ¦mosporidia is no longer
possible, because of the coccidian nature of the HÃ¦mogregarines
(<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_154">154</a>). The Coccidia are divisible into the Adeleidea and the
Eimeridea (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_141">141</a>). The HÃ¦mogregarinidÃ¦ are allied to the
former, and the PlasmodiidÃ¦ to the latter. The PiroplasmidÃ¦, until
more is known of their life-cycle in the invertebrate host, cannot be
more definitely placed.</p>

<p><b>The Leucocytozoa of Birds.</b>&mdash;Regarding the statement, on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_153">153</a>,
that Laveran and FranÃ§a consider that avian leucocytozoa may inhabit
red blood cells, it may be added that FranÃ§a<a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">1271</a> (April, 1915) remarks
that the action of the parasites on the red cells is very rapid and
very intense. The host cells become so altered that it is difficult
to recognize their true nature. He used very young birds in his
researches. Two shapes of host cell are considered, namely, those
with fusiform prolongations, and those which are rounded and without
such prolongations (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_153">153</a>). The movements and form of
the Leucocytozoa determine the shape of the host cell, as was pointed
out by Fantham<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">1272</a> in 1910.</p>

<p>Schizogony of these parasites has been seen by FranÃ§a (1915) and
by Coles (1914), in addition to Fantham (1910), and to Moldovan
(1913), mentioned on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_153">153</a>. Schizogony may also take place in the
lungs of the host. The genus <i>LeucocytozoÃ¶n</i>, established by Ziemann
in 1898, belongs to the family HÃ¦mamÅbidÃ¦.</p>


<h5>II.&mdash;FORMULÃ OF SOME CULTURE MEDIA.</h5>

<p>(1) <b>Culture Media for growing AmÅbÃ¦.</b>&mdash;There has been much
discussion as to whether the true parasitic <i>EntamÅbÃ¦</i> or <i>EndamÅbÃ¦</i>
can be grown on culture media (<i>see</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_42">42</a>). Undoubtedly certain
free-living amÅbÃ¦ can be so grown, and it is considered that some
of the earlier researches on the so-called artificial growth of the
dysenteric amÅbÃ¦ were really due to contaminations with free-living
forms. The following media are worthy of <span class="nowrap">note:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="743"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743"></a></span></p>

<p>Musgrave and Clegg in 1904 devised a culture medium for
amÅbÃ¦. The organisms grown by them were probably not dysenteric
amÅbÃ¦, as was thought, but free-living forms. Phillips<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">1273</a> (1915)
gives a slightly modified formula of Musgrave and Cleggâs medium,
<span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Without clarifying, sterilize at 7 kilograms pressure per square centimetre
for about three-quarters of an hour. It should be neutral to
phenolphthalein.</p>

<p>Anna W. Williams<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">1274</a> (1911) described a medium consisting of fresh
tissue spread on agar plates for the culture of amÅbÃ¦. There are
three stages in the procedure: (1) obtaining living amÅbÃ¦ free from
other living organisms; (2) obtaining sterile tissue; and (3) making
successive transplants of amÅbÃ¦ and tissue, and showing that every
transplant is free from other living organisms. Each step requires
many controls. The essentials of the method may now be given.
Remove aseptically and rapidly the tissue required, such as brain,
liver, kidney, or spleen, from a freshly killed animal (guinea-pig,
rabbit, or dog). Put each tissue on a separate agar plate. Cut the
selected tissue into tiny pieces, and spread them over freshly made
agar plates. Place these plates in a thermostat at 36Â°&nbsp;C. for twenty-four
hours to insure sterility. Add the broken up tissue to the
amÅbÃ¦, free from bacteria, and maintain the cultures in thermostats,
some at 36Â°&nbsp;C., and some at 20Â°&nbsp;C. to 24Â°&nbsp;C. Emulsions of liver and
brain in sterile neutral glycerine may also be used. The freshly
removed tissue serves as food for the amÅbÃ¦.</p>

<p>The cultural amÅbÃ¦ mentioned on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_42">42</a> were grown on such
media or modifications thereof. One modified medium actually used
was brain tissue, to which blood was added from day to day, and an
easily assimilable bacterium (one of the influenza group of bacilli)
was present, which did not overgrow the medium at a temperature of
38Â°&nbsp;C. Different conditions of food and of temperature produced
morphological variations in the cultural amÅbÃ¦.</p>

<p>Couret and J. Walker<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">1275</a> (1913) state that they have cultivated five
varieties of intestinal amÅbÃ¦, the associated bacteria having been
previously separated. They used a medium consisting of agar to<span class="pagenum" title="744"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744"></a></span>
which sterile autolysed tissue had been added. The sterile tissue,
such as brain or liver, was kept in a sterile thermostat at a temperature
of 40Â°&nbsp;C. for ten to twenty days. The surface of the agar should
be broken up before use, and the medium must not be too acid (not
over 1Â·5 per cent.). They consider that autolysed tissue is necessary
for the growth of EntamÅbÃ¦, and that naturally associated bacteria
aid growth by autolysing the tissues.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Culture Media for the growth of Protozoa parasitic in the
Blood.</b>&mdash;MacNeal and Novy,<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">1276</a> in 1903, used a mixture of blood and
agar for the cultivation of trypanosomes such as <i>T. lewisi</i> and <i>T. brucei</i>.
They employed varying proportions of the blood and agar, a medium
consisting of two parts of defibrinated rabbitâs blood mixed with one
part of agar being useful. The trypanosomes grew in the water of
condensation. Some of the authorsâ earlier formulÃ¦ contained
different proportions of blood and agar with a little peptone, while
one of these media contained meat extract, agar, peptone, salt and
sodium carbonate. The temperature, like the proportion of blood
and agar, varied with the trypanosome investigated, but the optimum
was 25Â°&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>Mathis<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">1277</a> (1906) somewhat simplified the technique of Novy and
MacNeal. He collected the blood of a suitable animal, such as rabbit,
cow or dog, strict asepsis not being essential. The blood was
defibrinated in the ordinary way. One part of blood was added
to two parts of agar at 50Â°&nbsp;C. The mixture was sterilized several
times by heating to 75Â°&nbsp;C. or 100 Â° C. Slopes were made and the
water of condensation was inoculated with a little blood containing
the trypanosomes. Blood may be obtained from a superficial vein
or from the heart.</p>

<p><i>Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle or N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;N. Medium.</i>&mdash;In 1908 C. Nicolle<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a>
brought forward a modification of the Novy-MacNeal (N.N.)
medium. The formula is as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Apparently pure sodium chloride can be substituted equally
well for sea salt. The mixture is placed in tubes and sterilized in
an autoclave. To each tube one-third of its volume of rabbit
blood, taken by aseptic puncture of the heart, is added. The salt
agar is kept liquid at 45Â°&nbsp;C. to 50Â°&nbsp;C. and the blood is added to
the mixture. The culture medium so prepared is maintained for
five days at 37Â°&nbsp;C., and then for a few days at room temperature.<span class="pagenum" title="745"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745"></a></span>
This medium was devised for the cultivation of <i>Leishmania</i> (<i>see</i>
p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_106">106</a>), but trypanosomes may also be grown thereon. Subsequently,
Nicolle recommended the use of citrated ratâs blood heated to 45Â°&nbsp;C.
for half an hour, instead of defibrinated rabbitâs blood. On such a
medium, J.&nbsp;G. Thomson and Sinton<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a> (1912) succeeded in growing
<i>Trypanosoma gambiense</i> and <i>T. rhodesiense</i> (<i>see</i> pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_76">76</a>, 83).</p>

<p>Noguchiâs media for the cultivation of SpirochÃ¦tes and Treponemata
are described on pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_123">123</a>, 125. Hataâs modification is

<p>Bassâs glucose-blood medium for the cultivation of malarial
parasites is described on pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_170">170</a>â172. It has also been used

<h5>III.&mdash;BRIEF NOTES ON GENERAL PROTOZOOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE.</h5>

<p>The object of this book is to give accounts of the structure and
life-histories of the numerous parasitic organisms that affect man
more particularly. It is, therefore, inappropriate to devote much
space to a consideration of technique, regarding which many volumes
have already been written. Methods of procedure are largely matters
of opinion, and the technique that gives brilliant results when used
by one investigator may be a complete failure in the hands of
another. In the present appendix, brief notes regarding certain
relatively simple methods only can be given, because the number of
fixatives in use is very great; there are also large numbers of stains
as well as many modifications of them, while the methods of applying
both fixatives and stains are, perhaps, still more numerous.
There are so many, in fact, that confusion frequently arises from
the multiplicity of choice presented to the worker. Those desiring
more information on the subject of technique are advised to consult
the treatises of Bolles Lee<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a> and of Langeron.<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a></p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Fresh Material.</b></p>

<p class="tac">(<i>a</i>) <i>Simple Examination.</i></p>

<p><i>Fluid Substances, such as Blood and Sputum.</i>&mdash;A small quantity of
the substance to be examined is taken on a sterile platinum loop and
transferred to a perfectly clean glass slide. A clean cover-slip is gently
lowered on to the drop, air bubbles being avoided. The preparation<span class="pagenum" title="746"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746"></a></span>
is luted with vaseline or paraffin and examined first with a low power
and then with a high power objective. The light is cut down by
partly closing the diaphragm of the substage of the microscope.</p>

<p><i>Skin Ulcers and Similar Sores.</i>&mdash;Scrapings are made from the edge
of the sore, mixed with sterile physiological salt solution, and
prepared and examined as above.</p>

<p><i>FÃ¦ces.</i>&mdash;A small portion of fÃ¦ces, or flakes of mucus (which may
be blood-stained) from the same, is removed on a sterile platinum
loop, spread out thinly after dilution, if necessary, with physiological
salt solution on a slide, covered and examined as before.</p>

<p>Alternatively, hanging drop preparations of blood, ulcerative tissue,
or fÃ¦ces, appropriately diluted if necessary with sodium citrate or
physiological salt solution, may be made on a cover-slip, which is
inverted over a slide with a well in it. The cover-slip is then luted and
examined.</p>

<p>For the elucidation of the developmental processes of such
organisms as trypanosomes, spirochÃ¦tes and piroplasms, fresh
preparations may be often kept under observation longer by the
use of a thermostat, maintained at or near blood heat, in which the
microscope is inserted.</p>


<p class="ph1">(<i>b</i>) <i>Intra vitam Staining of fresh Preparations.</i></p>

<p><i>Intra vitam</i> staining is of service on some occasions, more
particularly for the study of the nucleus and other chromatoid
substances of the living organism. Two methods are in common
use. In the first case, the stain, employed usually in very dilute
solution, is mixed with the medium containing the organism. The
latter takes up some of the stain, the amount of coloration depending
on the organism concerned and on the stain employed.</p>

<p>The commoner <i>intra vitam</i> stains are pure, medicinal (zinc-free)
methylene blue and neutral red, used in aqueous solutions. A solution
of methylene blue of 1 per 1,000 of water may be tried, while neutral
red in the proportion of 1 per 3,000 parts of water has proved of
service.</p>

<p>The second method of vital colouring consists in placing a drop of
1 per cent. solution of methylene blue on a slide or cover-slip, slightly
spreading it, and allowing it to dry. The living organism is then
placed in a drop of saline on the prepared slide or cover-slip, which
is then mounted and examined under the microscope. Progressive
staining of the organism occurs and its internal structure can be seen.
A similar procedure may be followed for neutral red. <i>Intra vitam</i>
staining is useful for relatively large and easily deformed protozoa
such as ciliates, as well as for amÅbÃ¦ and flagellata of the gut.</p>

<p>When examining very actively motile organisms, it is sometimes<span class="pagenum" title="747"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747"></a></span>
useful to endeavour to restrict their movements by adding a little gum
or gelatine to the medium.</p>


<p class="ph1">(<i>c</i>) <i>Examination by aid of the Paraboloid Condenser.</i></p>

<p>The use of one of the dark-ground illuminators (so-called ultra-microscopes)
is of service for the detection of minute living organisms
or of organisms present in small numbers only. The forms of
paraboloid condenser manufactured by the firms of Zeiss and Leitz
can be recommended. For details of their methods of employment,
reference should be made to the leaflets of the firms supplying the
said instruments. By the use of the paraboloid condenser, the finer
details of certain stages of life-cycles, such as the formation of
granules in spirochÃ¦tes and treponemata, can be observed more
readily than by using the ordinary substage of the microscope.
The use of the paraboloid condenser for the detection of small
numbers of living organisms renders it of value for rapid diagnostic
purposes.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Stained Material.</b></p>

<p>Fuller accounts of the technique of fixed and stained material
will be found in Bolles Lee and in Langeron, already mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Thin Films.</i>&mdash;For the examination of blood-inhabiting Protozoa,
it is necessary to make first thin films or smears of blood. There are
many ways of doing this, and opinions differ as to their respective
merits. A simple method is to take a straight surgical needle about
2&nbsp;in. long, the eye of which has been removed, and a clean glass slide.
The patientâs skin is pricked, and when the bead of blood reaches
the size of a small pinâs head, the slide is applied to the surface of
the blood, about <span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">3</span></span></span>&nbsp;in. from the far (left-hand) end of the slide.
The shaft of the needle is laid across the drop of blood, which
spreads between the slide and the needle. The latter is drawn evenly
along the slide towards the right. The film is dried by waving it in
the air. The film should possess a straight edge parallel with that of
the slide and should be as uniform and thin as possible. Another
glass slide may be used as a spreader, or a cover-slip or thin glass
rod may be employed.</p>

<p><i>Thick Films.</i>&mdash;These are of service in detecting malarial parasites
or trypanosomes, especially when the parasites are few. The method
of Ross, or a modification thereof, has been much used. A small drop
of fresh blood is spread evenly and quickly with a needle-point over
a square area somewhat less than that of an ordinary square cover-glass.
The blood is allowed to dry. The film is then carefully
dehÃ¦moglobinized in water in which there is a trace of acetic acid.
The dehÃ¦moglobinizing fluid is then carefully drained off and the<span class="pagenum" title="748"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748"></a></span>
film again dried. It is fixed in absolute alcohol and stained with
Romanowskyâs solution. A cubic millimetre of blood divided into
quarters may be thus dehÃ¦moglobinized and stained. The parasites
in such a cubic millimetre of blood may be counted. Such a procedure
was followed by R. Ross and D. Thomson,<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a> in determining the
periodic variation of the numbers of trypanosomes in the blood of
a patient, as mentioned and figured on pp.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_78">78</a> and 79.</p>


<p class="mt2em">For cytological details of various Protozoa, thin film preparations
on cover-slips or slides are often useful. Cover-slip preparations are
preferable, unless the organisms under investigation are extremely
scanty. The medium containing the organisms, such as blood,
lymph, intestinal contents, sputum, scrapings of ulcers, and urine, is
spread thinly, either alone or diluted with a little physiological salt
solution, on the cover-slip. Fixation while still <i>wet</i> is necessary.
Various methods are employed.</p>

<p><b>Fixatives.</b>&mdash;A useful procedure is to fix the wet film by exposure
to 4 per cent. osmic acid vapour for ten to thirty seconds, then place
in absolute alcohol for five minutes to harden. Grade down from
absolute alcohol through 90 per cent., 70 per cent., 50 per cent., and
30 per cent. alcohols to water. Stain wet with a suitable stain such
as hÃ¦matoxylin, and gradually dehydrate by grading through the
necessary strengths of alcohol, clear in xylol or other oily clearing
medium and mount in Canada balsam.</p>

<p>Other fixatives may be employed, such as are also useful for fixing
pieces of tissue for sectioning. Films or smears on cover-slips while
<i>still wet</i> are floated on the surface of the fixative in a watch glass.
Some good fixatives of wide application <span class="nowrap">are:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Schaudinnâs Fluid.</i>&mdash;This consists of a mixture of</p>


<div class="center">

<tr><td class="tal">Absolute alcohol</td><td class="tar"><div>1</div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;volume</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Two modifications of Schaudinnâs formula may be found useful.
A saturated solution of corrosive sublimate in physiological salt
solution may be substituted for the aqueous one, and the addition of
a few drops of glacial acetic acid to either of the preceding mixtures
may be made.</p>

<p>Some workers prefer to use hot fixatives, raised to a temperature
of about 50Â°&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>Fixation by corrosive sublimate solutions must be followed by
thorough removal of the mercury salt by washing repeatedly in
30 per cent. alcohol or with iodine-alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="749"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Bouinâs Fluid</i>, or modifications thereof, is also very useful for wet
fixation. Bouinâs picro-formol solution consists <span class="nowrap">of:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The best-known modification is one due to Duboscq and Brasil,
and often known as <i>Bouin-Duboscq Fluid</i>. Its formula is as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>Thorough washing of the smear or cover-slip preparation with
70 per cent. alcohol until the yellow colour disappears is necessary
to remove excess of fixative.</p>

<p>Other fixatives, which may be of use, more especially for fixing
small pieces of tissue for sectioning, are the solutions of Flemming
(chromo-aceto-osmic acids) and of Zenker (sublimate-bichromate-acetic,
with sodium sulphate).</p>

<p>Regarding the time of fixation, there is much difference of opinion.
Usually, exposure to or contact with the fixative for five minutes is
sufficient in the case of films or smears. Material for sections
should be cut into small cubic pieces, of a thickness of about
5&nbsp;mm. (<span class="nowrap">â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">5</span></span></span>&nbsp;in.). One or two hours should be sufficient time for the
fixation of such pieces of tissue, though some, as Langeron, prefer
a longer time of fixation. On the other hand, Gustav Mann<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a> recommends
a short fixation period. The excess of fixative should be
thoroughly washed out of the tissue in the manner appropriate to
the particular fixative used. If it is desired to keep the tissue for some
time before sectioning and staining, it should be transferred to 70 per
cent. alcohol.</p>

<p>When fluid fixatives are employed, large quantities of the fixing
media are necessary. The volume of the fixative should be at least
ten to twenty times that of the object, and the latter should be suspended
in the middle of the fixative. The tissue should be fixed as
soon as possible after the death of the host.</p>

<p>For sectioning tissue parasitized by Protozoa, embedding in
paraffin is generally recommended. Microtome sections should not,
if possible, exceed 5&nbsp;Âµ in thickness. Details of special procedures
must be sought in larger works.</p>

<p><b>Staining.</b>&mdash;Here, as with fixatives, much choice is presented. The
various modifications of the Romanowsky stain have aided greatly in<span class="pagenum" title="750"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750"></a></span>
the detection of various Protozoa parasitic in the blood. Such
stains, however, leave something to be desired in the revealing of finer
cytological details. Other stains, more especially the hÃ¦matoxylins,
must be employed for cytological purposes.</p>

<p>FormulÃ¦ of some of the principal Romanowsky and hÃ¦matoxylin
stains may now be given.</p>

<p>The underlying principle of the <i>Romanowsky Stain</i> is the reaction
between alkaline methylene blue and eosin, forming the so-called
eosinate of methylene blue which stains chromatin purplish-red.
A solution of medicinal methylene blue after having been subjected
to the action of an alkali, such as sodium carbonate, becomes partly
converted into certain derivatives, the chief of which are methylene
azure and methylene violet. These substances are also present in
matured polychrome methylene blue.</p>

<p>The formula of a <i>slightly modified Romanowsky Stain</i> which gives
excellent results is given <span class="nowrap">below:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="ml3em fs85">This solution must be kept in the dark, in dark-tinted (amber-coloured) bottles, as unfortunately
it is decolorized by light.</p>

<p>Before use each stock solution must be diluted. Thus, make up
5&nbsp;c.c. of each stock solution to 100&nbsp;c.c. by adding distilled water.
For staining, 1 volume of solution A is added to 2 or 3 volumes of
solution B. Mix thoroughly by shaking, pour the mixture over the
film, previously fixed in absolute alcohol, and stain for ten to fifteen
minutes. Wash carefully in running water, then dry. The cytoplasm
of a protozoan parasite will be stained blue, the chromatin purplish-red
and vacuoles or very tenuous protoplasm will remain colourless.</p>

<p>The exact proportions of solutions A and B, which must be
mixed together, should be determined by experiment. Freshly mixed
stain must be used on each occasion.</p>

<p><i>Leishmanâs Stain</i> is the precipitate resulting from the interaction
of alkaline methylene blue and eosin. The washed and dried
precipitate is collected and dissolved in pure methyl alcohol, which
acts as a fixative; 0Â·015&nbsp;grm. of Leishman powder may be dissolved
in 10&nbsp;c.c. of methyl alcohol for staining films. The film is covered
with the solution for one minute, twice the volume of water is then
added and mixed with the stain on the slide. The staining is then<span class="pagenum" title="751"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751"></a></span>
continued for five to ten minutes, and the film is finally washed with
water.</p>

<p><i>Giemsaâs Stain.</i>&mdash;This should be procured ready made. Azure II
is a mixture of methylene azure and methylene blue. (Methylene
azure is sometimes known as Giemsaâs Azure I.) The formula given

<p>The details of the application of the Giemsa stain to films fixed

the use of Pappenheimâs Panchrome mixture.</p>

<p class="mt2em">There are numerous formulae of stains containing ripened <i>HÃ¦matoxylin</i>
or its essential principle, <i>HÃ¦matein</i>. A mordant is necessary,
one of the alums being usually employed. The mordant may be
included as an ingredient in the staining mixture, or it may be used
separately as in the case of the so-called iron-hÃ¦matoxylins, wherein
ferric ammonium alum is used separately and is followed by staining
with hÃ¦matoxylin or hÃ¦matein. A few of these stains of general

<p>Allow the mixture to stand until the colour is sufficiently deep,
then filter and place in a stoppered bottle. The solution should be
allowed to ripen for at least two months before use. Dilute aqueous
solutions of the stain are of service for films and for sections. A
trace of acetic acid may be added at the moment of use, for sharp
differentiation.</p>

<p>Ehrlichâs acid hÃ¦matoxylin, Mayerâs hÃ¦malum, and Mayerâs
glychÃ¦malum are also useful. Their formulÃ¦ will be found in larger
works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="752"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752"></a></span></p>

<p>The chief <i>Iron-HÃ¦matoxylin Stain</i> is that devised by Heidenhain.
Unfortunately the procedure involved is a long one, and various
modifications have been made to obviate this disadvantage. HÃ¦matein
may be used instead of ripened hÃ¦matoxylin.</p>

<p>One efficacious modification of Heidenhainâs stain is that of
<i>Rosenbusch</i>. The smear or tissue, after fixation, must be graded
downwards through the alcohols to water. Mordant for one and a
half hours in a <span class="nowrap">3â<span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> per cent. aqueous solution of ferric ammonium
sulphate. Stain for about three minutes in 1 per cent. solution of
ripe hÃ¦matoxylin or hÃ¦matein in absolute or 96 per cent. alcohol,
to which a drop of saturated aqueous solution of lithium carbonate,
sufficient to produce a wine-red colour, has been added. Differentiate
under the microscope with a very dilute solution of the ferric
ammonium sulphate. Wash, gradually dehydrate, clear and mount
in balsam. It must be remarked that iron-hÃ¦matoxylin is a regressive
stain, hence great care must be exercised in differentiating with the
iron alum.</p>

<p><i>Gentian Violet.</i>&mdash;A 1 per cent. alcoholic solution of gentian violet,
or of methyl violet, or of crystal violet, will be found useful for staining
spirochÃ¦tes.</p>

<p><i>Methyl Green.</i>&mdash;This substance is considered to be a chromatin
stain, for either fresh or perhaps recently fixed tissues. A concentrated
aqueous solution contains about 1 per cent. of the stain. This
should be added to a 1 per cent. solution of acetic acid. It may
be used for demonstrating the nuclei of ciliates.</p>

<p class="mt2em">In conclusion it is essential to remember that the actual magnification
of figures of Protozoa should be given, and not merely the
combination of objective and ocular that has been used, for unless
the tube-length and distance of the drawing board from the ocular be
also given, it is not possible to compute the magnification from such
information. Drawings should always be made with the aid of
a camera lucida, drawing prism or other form of projection apparatus.</p>

<p>Pigment spots (eyes) anterior to ventral sucker absent, cuticular
keel on forks of tail absent.</p>

<p>In <i>Bullinus</i> sp. and <i>Planorbis boissyi</i> in Egypt, (?) in <i>Physopsis
africana</i>, South Africa. Adult form, <i>Schistosoma hÃ¦matobium</i>.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Cercaria bilharziella</b>, Leiper, 1915.</p>

<p>Cuticular keel on tail forks present. Pigment spots (eyes) in front
of ventral sucker present.</p>

<p>In <i>Planorbis boissyi</i> and <i>P. mareoticus</i>, and in <i>Melania</i> sp. Adult
form (?).</p>

<p>For characters of numerous other cercariÃ¦ which occur in fresh
water molluscs <i>see</i> âDie Susswasserfauna Deutschlands,â Max LÃ¼he,
H. 17 (Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1909).</p>

<p>The characters of <i>Cercaria japonica</i> of <i>S. japonicum</i> in the mollusc
<i>Katayama nosophora</i> and of <i>C. mansoni</i> have still to be defined.</p>


<p class="ph1"><b>Schistosoma mansoni</b>, Sambon, 1907.</p>

<p>The evidence appears to be strong that terminal-spined eggs are
not found in the West Indies, and that therefore the lateral-spined
eggs found in fÃ¦ces there belong probably to <i>S. mansoni</i>. If this
be true, then the egg described by Stephens and Christophers
in man in India probably also belongs to another species of
Schistosome.</p>


<h5>NEMATODA.</h5>

<p><b>Ancylostomiasis.</b>&mdash;Treatment: (1) <i>Oleum chenopodii</i> (U.S.P.),
dose â x to â xv on a lump of sugar, three doses at two-hourly
intervals, preceded and followed by a purge. It is cheap, not
unpleasant to take, and non-toxic. Effective also against <i>Ascaris
lumbricoides</i>.</p>

<p>(2) Milk of the higueron <i>Ficus laurifolia</i>. A spoonful in milk,
three times daily for three days followed by a purge. Described as a
harmless but very successful form of treatment.</p>

<p><b>Ground-itch.</b>&mdash;Completely cured in a few days by a 3 per cent.
solution of salicylic acid in ethyl alcohol. Apply for five minutes
twice daily.</p>

<p><b>Ascaris lumbricoides</b> can be kept alive for twelve days in
Kroneckerâs solution; NaOH 0Â·069 grammes, normal saline 1,000&nbsp;c.c.</p>

<p>Eggs are laid and develop in about a fortnight at ordinary room
temperature. At 70Â°&nbsp;C. they are readily killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="755"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755"></a></span></p>

<p><b>Filariasis.</b>&mdash;Dutcher and Whitmarsh have cultivated from the
blood and from the exudation fluids of cases of filariasis (elephantiasis,
lymphangitis, etc.), in about sixteen cases, a bacillus resembling
<i>B. subtilis</i>. Controls were negative. They propose the name <i>Bacillus
lymphangiticus</i> for this organism, and they believe it to be the cause
of the diseases grouped under the designation âfilariasis.â</p>

<p><b>Oncocerca volvulus.</b>&mdash;<i>Unsheathed</i> embryos (indistinguishable from
those taken from the uterus of this worm) have been found in lymphatic
glands and in the blood (if considerable pressure is used so as
to squeeze out lymph at the time of taking the finger blood, otherwise
none occurs in the specimens). The measurements in dried films
are: Nerve ring 23Â·7 per cent. of length; G1 cell 69Â·6 per cent.;
end of last tail cell 96Â·3 per cent; total length 274Â·3&nbsp;Âµ.</p>

<p><b>Strongyloides stercoralis.</b>&mdash;Pathology: They occur in the wall
of the intestine and may be associated with ulceration. They also
occur in lymphatics and blood-vessels.</p>

According to Sambon, the RicinidÃ¦ are by no means advantageous to their hosts. These
Hemipterous parasites give rise to an intolerable itching which may cause loss of rest, emaciation,
and sometimes even death. Birds suffering from phthiriasis of the Ricines are usually
in bad health.</p></div>

However, in the Protozoa there are examples of hereditary transmission of parasites, <i>e.g.</i>,
in the case of <i>Babesia</i> (<i>Piroplasma</i>) <i>bovis</i> and <i>Babesia canis</i> in their invertebrate hosts (ticks);
in <i>Crithidia melophagia</i> and <i>Crithidia hyalommÃ¦</i>; and in the case of <i>SpirochÃ¦ta duttoni</i> in its

Independently of propagation, many protozoa protect themselves from death by encystment
when the water in which they are living dries up; in this condition the wind may carry
them over wide tracts of land.</p></div>

To explain this discrepancy it is stated that the border of the undulating membrane can be
detached in the form of an independent flagellum. But Parisi (1910) places such quadriflagellate
forms in the sub-genus <i>Tetratrichomonas</i>, <i>Arch. f. Protistenk.</i>, xix, p.&nbsp;232.</p></div>

According to Marchand, the nucleus is connected with a line, which becomes visible on
addition of acetic acid, terminates at the posterior extremity, and does not correspond to the
line of insertion of the undulating membrane. This formation probably is the same as the
axostyle in <i>Trichomonas batrachorum</i>, Perty. Blochmann (1884) also mentions two longitudinal
rows of granules, which commence at the same place as the nucleus and converge posteriorly.</p></div>

and in 1875 (in the <i>Russian Medical Report</i>, No. 33), a species identical with

Notwithstanding the progress made during the last decades, the ova of helminthes
and more particularly of trematodes, have been mistaken for Coccidia. Thus Poschinger
(<i>Zool. Anz.</i>, 1819, ix, p.&nbsp;471) and Gebhard (<i>Virchowâs Arch.</i>, 1897, No. 147, p.&nbsp;536) mistook
the ova of <i>Distoma turgidum</i>, Brds., for Coccidia. Podwyssotzki (<i>Centralbl. f. allg. Path.</i>,
1890, i, p.&nbsp;135) made a similar error with the ova (and vitelline sacs) of a species of <i>Prosthogonimus</i>
(<i>Distoma ovatum</i> of the authors); von Willach (<i>Arch. f. wiss. u. prakt. Thierheilk.</i>,
1892, xviii, p.&nbsp;242) mistook the ova of a nematode for Coccidia.</p></div>

Quinine is still almost exclusively the remedy used in the treatment of malaria. It is
prepared from the bark of the cinchona tree. This important remedy was introduced into
Europe in 1640 from Ecuador by Juan del Vego, physician of the Countess del Cinchon.</p></div>

The discovery of Laveran is in no way lessened by the fact that one investigator or
another (according to Blanchard [<i>Arch. de Paras.</i>, vii, 1903, p.&nbsp;152], P.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;H. Klencke
in 1843) had seen, mentioned and depicted malarial parasites. (<i>Neue phys. Abhandl.
auf. selbstÃ¤nd. Beob. gegr.</i>, Leipzig, 1843, p.&nbsp;163, fig.&nbsp;25). In 1847 Meckel had recognized
that the dark colour of the organs in persons dead of malaria was due to pigment. Virchow
in 1848 stated that this pigment occurred in blood cells. Kelsch in 1875 recognized the
frequency of melaniferous leucocytes in the blood of malarial patients. Beauperthuy (1853)
noticed that in Guadeloupe there was no malaria at altitudes where there were no âinsectes
tipulaires,â and suggested that the disease was inoculated by insects.</p></div>

It should be remembered that some authors (Laveran, Argutinsky, Panichi, Serra) argue
against the intra-globular position of malarial parasites and state that they only adhere outwardly
to the red blood corpuscles. These views have recently been revived by Mary Rowley-Lawson,
and she states that the malarial parasite is âextracellular throughout its life-cycle and
migrates from red corpuscle to red corpuscle destroying each before it abandons it.â (<i>Journ.
Exper. Med.</i>, 1914, xix, p.&nbsp;531.)</p></div>

If the microgametocytes are sufficiently mature the formation of microgametes occurs in
the blood of man as soon as it is taken from the blood-vessel and has been cooled and
diluted. Such a stage is called a <i>Polymitus</i> form, and the process has been called
âexflagellation.â</p></div>

The pigment masses (melanin or hÃ¦mozoin) are taken up by the leucocytes, particularly
the mononuclear ones, and are carried especially to the spleen, and also to the liver and the
bone-marrow. From this circumstance arises the well-known pigmentation of the spleen in
persons who have suffered from malaria.</p></div>

According to Gourvitch (âBal. coli. Darmk. d. Menschen,â <i>Russ. Arch. f. Path., klin.
med. u. Bact.</i>, Petrograd, 1896), the conjugated Balantidia are supposed to fuse with each
other and form oval cysts two or three times the size of the free organisms, and to divide into
numerous globules within the cystic membrane; the process, however, has hitherto not been
confirmed. The supposed Balantidium cysts appeared in two patients who were simultaneously
suffering from <i>Dibothriocephalus latus</i>, after the administration of anthelminthics. It therefore
seems, according to the description, that in reality these forms were actually abnormally large,
possibly swollen, young eggs of the tape-worm mentioned.</p></div>

This grouping goes back to the year 1800, and was made by J.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;H. Zeder, a physician
and helminthologist of Forchheim, who divided the helminths, which until 1851 were generally
regarded as a special class of animals, into the groups of round, hook, sucker, tape and
bladder worms, as which they are recognized up to the present time. In 1809, K.&nbsp;A. Rudolphi
gave them the names <i>Nematodes</i>, <i>Acanthocephali</i>, <i>Trematodes</i>, <i>Cestodes</i> and <i>Cystici</i>.</p></div>

The following conditions represent deviations from this type: (1) In <i>Gasterostomum</i>
the oral aperture is situated in the middle of the ventral surface, and occasionally is
even nearer to the posterior than to the anterior end. There is no proper oral sucker,
but the pharynx is thus termed. (2) A few genera, such as <i>Gasterostomum</i>, <i>Aspidogaster</i>,
<i>Diplozoon</i>, etc., have only <i>one</i> intestinal diverticulum, which is undoubtedly to be taken
as representing the primitive condition, as it is also often found in the young stages
of the <i>Trematoda</i>. (3) The branches of the intestines are curved and united behind
(several <i>TristomidÃ¦</i> and <i>MonostomidÃ¦</i>), while in <i>Polystomum integerrimum</i> (in the bladder
of frogs) there are several commissures between the intestinal branches, and in the <i>SchistosomidÃ¦</i>
the united intestinal branches proceed as one channel towards the posterior end.
(4) The termination of the two intestinal branches is not always on a level; they are
therefore of different lengths. (5) When the Åsophagus is very long the intestinal branches
extend both forward and backward, so that the gut exhibits the form of an <b>H</b>. (6) In
the broad and flat species the gut-forks form diverticula mostly externally but also internally;
these again may branch (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_139">139</a>). (7) In a few cases (<i>Nematobothrium</i>, <i>Didymozoon</i>) the
intestine completely disappears up to the pharynx.</p></div>

The typical position of the genitalia is subject to many deviations, which are of
importance in the differentiation of the genera and families. The following are some few
of these deviations: (1) The genital pore remains on the ventral surface, but is situated
beside or behind the ventral sucker, or it becomes marginal, and is then found in front of or
beside the oral sucker, or at a lateral edge, or, finally, in the centre of the posterior border;
the ducts also correspondingly alter their direction. (2) The ovary usually lies in front of
the testes, not rarely, however, behind them or between them. (3) The three genital glands
mostly lie together close in front of, or behind, the centre of the body; they may be moved
far back, and may incidentally become separated one from the other. (4) The vitellarium
may be single, in which case it then may lie in the central field. (5) A few forms possess
but one, others several or numerous testes. Amongst the ectoparasitic trematodes there are
also species with but one testis; but they mostly have several. As a rule, their uterus is short,
but the oÃ¶type well developed. Special canals (vagina), single or double, are used for copulation,
not the uterus. The vitelline ducts also communicate with the intestine through the canalis
vitello-intestinalis (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_123">123</a>).</p></div>

[Recent work (<i>e.g.</i>, Goldschmidt, <i>Zool. Anzeiger</i>, xxxiv, p.&nbsp;482) has shown that the
older views regarding the formation of the egg must be modified. In certain species, at any
rate, the shell material is formed by the yellow droplets of the yolk glands and not by the so-called
shell gland (Mehliâs gland) secretion, which is clear and watery. The function of this
secretion accordingly still requires explanation; according to Looss it serves as a covering
secretion for the egg-shell proper. It appears also that other granules, the yolk granules as
distinct from the shell drop granules, are not always used up during the development of the
embryo and hence do not function as yolk, so these also when they exist, and frequently
they are wanting, must serve some other purpose, possibly that of imbibing water for the use
of the embryo.&mdash;J.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;S.]</p></div>

The cercaria is the characteristic larval stage of the Trematodes, and corresponds to a
cysticercus or cysticercoid, though there is the important difference that the cercaria has an
enteric cavity. According to some observers the enteron is represented by the frontal sucker
of some Cestodes, and by the rostellum of the majority of others.

The Greeks termed the tapeworms á¼Î»Î¼Î¹Î½Î¸ÎµÏ ÏÎ»Î±ÏÎµá¿Î±Î¹, more rarely ÏÎ·Ïá½·Î± (= fascia);
the Romans called them <i>tÃ¦nia</i>, <i>tinea</i>, <i>tÃ¦niola</i>, later <i>lumbrici</i>, usually with the addition <i>lati</i>,
to distinguish them from the <i>Lumbrici teretes</i> (<i>AscaridÃ¦</i>). The proglottids were called
<i>Vermes cucurbitini</i>; the cysticerci Ïá½±Î»Î±Î¶Î±Î¹ (hailstones), later hydatids. Plater (1602) was the
first to differentiate <i>TÃ¦nia intestinorum</i> (= <i>Bothriocephalus latus</i>) amongst the <i>Lumbrici lati</i>
of man from <i>TÃ¦nia longissima</i> (= <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i>). The term <i>solium</i> was already used by
Arnoldus Villanovanus, who lived about 1300; and, according to him, it signifies âcingulumâ
(belt, chain), while N. Andry, in 1700, traces this word from âsolus,â because the worm
occurs always singly in man. Leuckart and Krehl derive the word âsoliumâ from the Syrian
âschuschlâ (the chain), which in Arabian has become âsuslâ or âsosl,â and in Latin has
become âsol-ium.â What LinnÃ¦us described under the term <i>TÃ¦nia solium</i> was really
<i>TÃ¦nia saginata</i>; the latter was first distinguished by Goeze, but was forgotten until KÃ¼chenmeister,
in 1852, again called attention to the differences.</p></div>

The larvÃ¦ which on rare occasions are found in the muscular system of sheep are either
strayed specimens of <i>Cysticercus tenuicollis</i>, which normally develop in organs of the

Dressel, for instance, examined eighty-seven persons suffering from cysticercus, and
found it seventy-two times in the brain, thirteen times in the muscles; K. MÃ¼ller, in thirty-six
cases, found it twenty-one times in the brain, twelve times in the muscles, three times in
the heart; Haugg, in twenty-five cases, found it thirteen times in the brain, six times in the
muscles, twice in the skin, etc. According to Graefe, amongst 1,000 ophthalmic cases in
Halle and Berlin, there was one with cysticercus in the eye; in Stuttgart there was only one
in 4,000, in Paris one in 6,000, and in Copenhagen one in 8,000.</p></div>

The diagnosis as a rule is not difficult; the patients themselves frequently observe the
pumpkin seed-like segments in the fÃ¦ces. But in such cases the diagnosis must still be
confirmed. In other cases the discovery of the oncospheres in their embryonal shells
(embryophores), which cannot be confounded with the other constituents of the fÃ¦ces, gives
complete certainty, although the differential diagnosis between <i>T. solium</i> and <i>T. saginata</i>
is hardly possible from the embryophores; but, if evacuated segments are placed between
two slides and lightly pressed, the species is easily recognizable by the shape of the uterus
(<i>cf.</i> figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_239">239</a> and 241).</p></div>

even 40 to 50 per cent. of the dogs are affected. It is, however, a question whether, in addition

TrichinellÃ¦ that are unable to penetrate into muscular fibres invariably die, no matter

correct, as bundles of muscles are present in the fat of bacon. The TrichinellÃ¦ do not settle
in heart muscle, although they may reach it in cases of heavy infection; they then die or
wander into the pericardium, and eventually into the heart cavities.</p></div>

<p>(1) Abdomen with hairs but no scales. Thorax with dorsum with long narrow curved scales,
which form on the anterior promontory a thick bunch projecting over the neck. Prothoracic
lobes with a tuft of rather broad true scales, upright forked scales of head of usual
broad expanding type: Patagiamyia, James. Includes Gigas, Giles, and Lindesayi,
Giles. Both seem to me typical Anopheles.
</p>
<p>
(2) Abdomen as above; Thorax very similar. Prothoracic lobes with hairs, no scales. Upright
forked scales of head rod-shaped: Neostethopheles, James. Includes Atkenii, James;
Immaculatus, Theobald; Culiciformis, James and Liston. These seem to me to be true
Anopheles.
</p>
<p>
(3) Abdomen with hairs and scales on dorsum of each segment; ventrally there are six scaly
tufts on the apices of six segments. Thorax with scales and a tuft of outstanding ones
on prothoracic lobes: Christophersia, James. Type Halli, James. Very close to if not
identical with Cellia.
</p>
<p>
(4) Head with narrow curved scales lying rather flat upon head and flat lateral scales, upright
forked ones behind. Central lobe of scutellum with tuft of narrow curved scales, lateral
lobes with large flat oval scales; male palpi longer than proboscis, two large apical segments
with long projecting hairs: Leslieomyia, Christophers. Type <i>Leslieomyia tÃ¦niorhynchoides</i>,
Christophers, from Amritsar, India.
</p>
<p>
(5) Abdomen with first six or seven segments with hairs only, eighth and seventh (?) with
scales, also genital processes. Thorax with hairs and narrow curved scales sharp pointed,
blunt-ended broad scales on each side of anterior third. No tufts of scales on prothoracic
lobes. Head usual type of upright forked scales: Nyssomyzomyia, James. Type Rossii,
Giles.</p></div>

arranged in transverse series of groups of two or more, which can be seen to form more or less
distinct undulating and irregular transverse rows. In each of the two posterior stigmatic

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
